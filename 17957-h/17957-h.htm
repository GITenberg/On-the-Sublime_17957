<p><span class = "firstword">The</span>
text which has been followed in the present Translation is that of Jahn
(Bonn, 1867), revised by Vahlen, and republished in 1884. In several
instances it has been found necessary to diverge from Vahlen’s readings,
such divergencies being duly pointed out in the Notes.</p>

<p>One word as to the aim and scope of the present Translation. My
object throughout has been to make Longinus speak in English, to
preserve, as far as lay in my power, the noble fire and lofty tone of
the original. How to effect this, without being betrayed into a loose
paraphrase, was an exceedingly difficult problem. The style of Longinus
is in a high degree original, occasionally running into strange
eccentricities of language; and no one who has not made the attempt can
realise the difficulty of giving anything like an adequate version of
the more elaborate passages. These considerations I submit to those to
whom I may seem at first sight to have handled my text too freely.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
My best thanks are due to Dr. Butcher, Professor of Greek in the
University of Edinburgh, who from first to last has shown a lively
interest in the present undertaking which I can never sufficiently
acknowledge. He has read the Translation throughout, and acting on his
suggestions I have been able in numerous instances to bring my version
into a closer conformity with the original.</p>

<p>I have also to acknowledge the kindness of the distinguished writer
who has contributed the Introduction, and who, in spite of the heavy
demands on his time, has lent his powerful support to help on the work
of one who was personally unknown to him.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may be allowed to express a hope that the present
attempt may contribute something to reawaken an interest in an unjustly
neglected classic.</p>

<h5>TREATISE ON THE SUBLIME</h5>


<p><span class = "firstword">Boileau,</span>
in his introduction to his version of the ancient Treatise on the
Sublime, says that he is making no valueless present to his age. Not
valueless, to a generation which talks much about style and method in
literature, should be this new rendering of the noble fragment, long
attributed to Longinus, the Greek tutor and political adviser of
Zenobia. There is, indeed, a modern English version by Spurden,<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_i1" href = "#note_i1">I.1</a> but that is now rare,
and seldom comes into the market. Rare, too, is Vaucher’s critical essay
(1854), which is unlucky, as the French and English books both contain
valuable disquisitions on the age of the author of the Treatise. This
excellent work has had curious fortunes. It is never quoted nor referred
to by any extant classical writer, and, among the many books attributed
by Suidas to Longinus, it is not mentioned.
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
Decidedly the old world has left no more noble relic of criticism. Yet
the date of the book is obscure, and it did not come into the hands of
the learned in modern Europe till Robertelli and Manutius each published
editions in 1544. From that time the Treatise has often been printed,
edited, translated; but opinion still floats undecided about its origin
and period. Does it belong to the age of Augustus, or to the age of
Aurelian? Is the author the historical Longinus&mdash;the friend of
Plotinus, the tutor of Porphyry, the victim of Aurelian,&mdash;or have
we here a work by an unknown hand more than two centuries earlier?
Manuscripts and traditions are here of little service. The oldest
manuscript, that of Paris, is regarded as the parent of the rest. It is
a small quarto of 414 pages, whereof 335 are occupied by the “Problems”
of Aristotle. Several leaves have been lost, hence the fragmentary
character of the essay. The Paris MS. has an index, first mentioning the
“Problems,” and then <span title =
"DIONUSIOU Ê LONGINOU PERI HUPSOUS">ΔΙΟΝΥΣΙΟΥ Η ΛΟΓΓΙΝΟΥ ΠΕΡΙ
ΥΨΟΥΣ</span>, that is, “The work of Dionysius, or of Longinus, about the
Sublime.”</p>

<p>On this showing the transcriber of the MS. considered its authorship
dubious. Supposing that the author was Dionysius, which of the many
writers of that name was he? Again, if he was Longinus, how far does his
work tally with the
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
characteristics ascribed to that late critic, and peculiar to
his&nbsp;age?</p>

<p>About this Longinus, while much is written, little is certainly
known. Was he a descendant of a freedman of one of the Cassii Longini,
or of an eastern family with a mixture of Greek and Roman blood? The
author of the Treatise avows himself a Greek, and apologises, as a
Greek, for attempting an estimate of Cicero. Longinus himself was the
nephew and heir of Fronto, a Syrian rhetorician of Emesa. Whether
Longinus was born there or not, and when he was born, are things
uncertain. Porphyry, born in 233 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>,
was his pupil: granting that Longinus was twenty years Porphyry’s
senior, he must have come into the world about 213 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> He travelled much, studied in many cities, and
was the friend of the mystic Neoplatonists, Plotinus and Ammonius. The
former called him “a philologist, not a philosopher.” Porphyry shows us
Longinus at a supper where the plagiarisms of Greek writers are
discussed&mdash;a topic dear to trivial or spiteful mediocrity. He is
best known by his death. As the Greek secretary of Zenobia he inspired a
haughty answer from the queen to Aurelian, who therefore put him to
death. Many rhetorical and philosophic treatises are ascribed to him,
whereof only fragments survive. Did he write the Treatise on the
Sublime? Modern students prefer to believe that the famous
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
essay is, if not by Plutarch, as some hold, at least by some author of
his age, the age of the early Caesars.</p>

<p>The arguments for depriving Longinus, Zenobia’s tutor, of the credit
of the Treatise lie on the surface, and may be briefly stated. He
addresses his work as a letter to a friend, probably a Roman pupil,
Terentianus, with whom he has been reading a work on the Sublime by
Caecilius. Now Caecilius, a voluminous critic, certainly lived not later
than Plutarch, who speaks of him with a sneer. It is unlikely then that
an author, two centuries later, would make the old book of Caecilius the
starting-point of his own. He would probably have selected some recent
or even contemporary rhetorician. Once more, the writer of the Treatise
of the Sublime quotes no authors later than the Augustan period. Had he
lived as late as the historical Longinus he would surely have sought
examples of bad style, if not of good, from the works of the Silver Age.
Perhaps he would hardly have resisted the malicious pleasure of
censuring the failures among whom he lived. On the other hand, if he
cites no late author, no classical author cites him, in spite of the
excellence of his book. But we can hardly draw the inference that he was
of late date from this purely negative evidence.</p>

<p>Again, he describes, in a very interesting and
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
earnest manner, the characteristics of his own period (Translation, pp.
82-86). Why, he is asked, has genius become so rare? There are many
clever men, but scarce any highly exalted and wide-reaching genius. Has
eloquence died with liberty? “We have learned the lesson of a benignant
despotism, and have never tasted freedom.” The author answers that it is
easy and characteristic of men to blame the present times. Genius may
have been corrupted, not by a world-wide peace, but by love of gain and
pleasure, passions so strong that “I fear, for such men as we are it is
better to serve than to be free. If our appetites were let loose
altogether against our neighbours, they would be like wild beasts
uncaged, and bring a deluge of calamity on the whole civilised world.”
Melancholy words, and appropriate to our own age, when cleverness is
almost universal, and genius rare indeed, and the choice between liberty
and servitude hard to make, were the choice within our power.</p>

<p>But these words assuredly apply closely to the peaceful period of
Augustus, when Virgil and Horace “praising their tyrant sang,” not to
the confused age of the historical Longinus. Much has been said of the
allusion to “the Lawgiver of the Jews” as “no ordinary person,” but that
remark might have been made by a heathen acquainted with the Septuagint,
at either of the disputed dates.
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
On the other hand, our author (Section XIII) quotes the critical ideas
of “Ammonius and his school,” as to the debt of Plato to Homer. Now the
historical Longinus was a friend of the Neoplatonist teacher (not
writer), Ammonius Saccas. If we could be sure that the Ammonius of the
Treatise was this Ammonius, the question would be settled in favour of
the late date. Our author would be that Longinus who inspired Zenobia to
resist Aurelian, and who perished under his revenge. But Ammonius is not
a very uncommon name, and we have no reason to suppose that the
Neoplatonist Ammonius busied himself with the literary criticism of
Homer and Plato. There was, among others, an Egyptian Ammonius, the
tutor of Plutarch.</p>

<p>These are the mass of the arguments on both sides. M. Egger sums them
up thus: “After carefully examining the tradition of the MSS., and the
one very late testimony in favour of Longinus, I hesitated for long as
to the date of this precious work. In 1854 M. Vaucher<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_i2" href = "#note_i2">I.2</a> inclined me to believe that
Plutarch was the author.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i3" href =
"#note_i3">I.3</a> All seems to concur towards the opinion that, if not
Plutarch, at least one of his contemporaries wrote the most
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
original Greek essay in its kind since the <i>Rhetoric</i> and
<i>Poetic</i> of Aristotle.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i4" href =
"#note_i4">I.4</a></p>

<p>We may, on the whole, agree that the nobility of the author’s
thought, his habit of quoting nothing more recent than the Augustan age,
and his description of his own time, which seems so pertinent to that
epoch, mark him as its child rather than as a great critic lost among
the <i>somnia Pythagorea</i> of the Neoplatonists. On the other hand, if
the author be a man of high heart and courage, as he seems, so was that
martyr of independence, Longinus. Not without scruple, then, can we
deprive Zenobia’s tutor of the glory attached so long to his name.</p>

<p>Whatever its date, and whoever its author may be, the Treatise is
fragmentary. The lost parts may very probably contain the secret of its
period and authorship. The writer, at the request of his friend,
Terentianus, and dissatisfied with the essay of Caecilius, sets about
examining the nature of the Sublime in poetry and oratory. To the latter
he assigns, as is natural, much more literary importance than we do, in
an age when there is so little oratory of literary merit, and so much
popular rant. The subject of sublimity must naturally have attracted a
writer whose own moral nature was
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
pure and lofty, who was inclined to discover in moral qualities the true
foundation of the highest literary merit. Even in his opening words he
strikes the keynote of his own disposition, where he approves the saying
that “the points in which we resemble the divine nature are benevolence
and love of truth.” Earlier or later born, he must have lived in the
midst of literary activity, curious, eager, occupied with petty
questions and petty quarrels, concerned, as men in the best times are
not very greatly concerned, with questions of technique and detail. Cut
off from politics, people found in composition a field for their
activity. We can readily fancy what literature becomes when not only its
born children, but the minor busybodies whose natural place is politics,
excluded from these, pour into the study of letters. Love of notoriety,
vague activity, fantastic indolence, we may be sure, were working their
will in the sacred close of the Muses. There were literary sets,
jealousies, recitations of new poems; there was a world of amateurs, if
there were no papers and paragraphs. To this world the author speaks
like a voice from the older and graver age of Greece. If he lived late,
we can imagine that he did not quote contemporaries, not because he did
not know them, but because he estimated them correctly. He may have
suffered, as we suffer, from critics who, of all the world’s literature,
know only
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
“the last thing out,” and who take that as a standard for the past, to
them unfamiliar, and for the hidden future. As we are told that
excellence is not of the great past, but of the present, not in the
classical masters, but in modern Muscovites, Portuguese, or American
young women, so the author of the Treatise may have been troubled by
Asiatic eloquence, now long forgotten, by names of which not a shadow
survives. He, on the other hand, has a right to be heard because he has
practised a long familiarity with what is old and good. His mind has
ever been in contact with masterpieces, as the mind of a critic should
be, as the mind of a reviewer seldom is, for the reviewer has to hurry
up and down inspecting new literary adventurers. Not among their
experiments will he find a touchstone of excellence, a test of
greatness, and that test will seldom be applied to contemporary
performances. What is the test, after all, of the Sublime, by which our
author means the truly great, the best and most passionate thoughts,
nature’s high and rare inspirations, expressed in the best chosen words?
He replies that “a just judgment of style is the final fruit of long
experience.” “Much has he travelled in the realms of gold.”</p>

<p>The word “style” has become a weariness to think upon; so much is
said, so much is printed about the art of expression, about methods,
tricks, and
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
turns; so many people, without any long experience, set up to be judges
of style, on the strength of having admired two or three modern and
often rather fantastic writers. About our author, however, we know that
his experience has been long, and of the best, that he does not speak
from a hasty acquaintance with a few contemporary <i>précieux</i> and
<i>précieuses</i>. The bad writing of his time he traces, as much of our
own may be traced, to “the pursuit of novelty in thought,” or rather in
expression. “It is this that has turned the brain of nearly all our
learned world to-day.” “Gardons nous d’écrire trop bien,” he might have
said, “c’est la pire manière qu’il y’ait d’écrire.”<a class = "tag" name
= "tag_i5" href = "#note_i5">I.5</a></p>

<p>The Sublime, with which he concerns himself, is “a certain loftiness
and excellence of language,” which “takes the reader out of himself....
The Sublime, acting with an imperious and irresistible force, sways
every reader whether he will or no.” In its own sphere the Sublime does
what “natural magic” does in the poetical rendering of nature, and
perhaps in the same scarcely-to-be-analysed fashion. Whether this art
can be taught or not is a question which the author treats with modesty.
Then, as now, people were denying (and not unjustly) that this art can
be taught by rule. The author does not go so far as to say that
Criticism, “unlike
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
Justice, does little evil, and little good; that is, <i>if</i> to
entertain for a moment delicate and curious minds is to do little good.”
He does not rate his business so low as that. He admits that the
inspiration comes from genius, from nature. But “an author can only
learn from art when he is to abandon himself to the direction of his
genius.” Nature must “burst out with a kind of fine madness and divine
inspiration.” The madness must be <i>fine</i>. How can art aid it to
this end? By knowledge of, by sympathy and emulation with, “the great
poets and prose writers of the past.” By these we may be inspired, as
the Pythoness by Apollo. From the genius of the past “an effluence
breathes upon us.” The writer is not to imitate, but to keep before him
the perfection of what has been done by the greatest poets. He is to
look on them as beacons; he is to keep them as exemplars or ideals. He
is to place them as judges of his work. “How would Homer, how would
Demosthenes, have been affected by what I have written?” This is
practical counsel, and even the most florid modern author, after
polishing a paragraph, may tear it up when he has asked himself, “What
would Addison have said about this eloquence of mine, or Sainte Beuve,
or Mr. Matthew Arnold?” In this way what we call inspiration, that is
the performance of the heated mind, perhaps working at its best, perhaps
overstraining
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
itself, and overstating its idea, might really be regulated. But they
are few who consider so closely, fewer perhaps they who have the heart
to cut out their own fine or refined things. Again, our author suggests
another criterion. We are, as in Lamb’s phrase, “to write for
antiquity,” with the souls of poets dead and gone for our judges. But we
are also to write for the future, asking with what feelings posterity
will read us&mdash;if it reads us at all. This is a good discipline. We
know by practice what will hit some contemporary tastes; we know the
measure of smartness, say, or the delicate flippancy, or the sentence
with “a dying fall.” But one should also know that these are fancies of
the hour&mdash;these and the touch of archaism, and the spinster-like
and artificial precision, which seem to be points in some styles of the
moment. Such reflections as our author bids us make, with a little
self-respect added, may render our work less popular and effective, and
certainly are not likely to carry it down to remote posterity. But all
such reflections, and action in accordance with what they teach, are
elements of literary self-respect. It is hard to be conscientious,
especially hard for him who writes much, and of necessity, and for
bread. But conscience is never to be obeyed with ease, though the ease
grows with the obedience. The book attributed to Longinus will not have
missed
<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
its mark if it reminds us that, in literature at least, for conscience
there is yet a place, possibly even a reward, though that is
unessential. By virtue of reasonings like these, and by insisting that
nobility of style is, as it were, the bloom on nobility of soul, the
Treatise on the Sublime becomes a tonic work, wholesome to be read by
young authors and old. “It is natural in us to feel our souls lifted up
by the true Sublime, and, conceiving a sort of generous exultation, to
be filled with joy and pride, as though we had ourselves originated the
ideas which we read.” Here speaks his natural disinterested greatness
the author himself is here sublime, and teaches by example as well as
precept, for few things are purer than a pure and ardent admiration. The
critic is even confident enough to expect to find his own nobility in
others, believing that what is truly Sublime “will always please, and
please all readers.” And in this universal acceptance by the populace
and the literate, by critics and creators, by young and old, he finds
the true external canon of sublimity. The verdict lies not with
contemporaries, but with the large public, not with the little set of
dilettanti, but must be spoken by all. Such verdicts assign the crown to
Shakespeare and Molière, to Homer and Cervantes; we should not
clamorously anticipate this favourable judgment for Bryant or Emerson,
nor for the greatest of our own contemporaries.
<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
Boileau so much misconceived these lofty ideas that he regarded
“Longinus’s” judgment as solely that “of good sense,” and held that, in
his time, “nothing was good or bad till he had spoken.” But there is far
more than good sense, there is high poetic imagination and moral
greatness, in the criticism of our author, who certainly would have
rejected Boileau’s compliment when he selects Longinus as a literary
dictator.</p>

<p>Indeed we almost grudge our author’s choice of a subject. He who
wrote that “it was not in nature’s plan for us, her children, to be base
and ignoble; no, she brought us into life as into some great field of
contest,” should have had another field of contest than literary
criticism. It is almost a pity that we have to doubt the tradition,
according to which our author was Longinus, and, being but a
rhetorician, greatly dared and bravely died. Taking literature for his
theme, he wanders away into grammar, into considerations of tropes and
figures, plurals and singulars, trumpery mechanical pedantries, as we
think now, to whom grammar is no longer, as of old, “a new invented
game.” Moreover, he has to give examples of the faults opposed to
sublimity, he has to dive into and search the bathos, to dally over
examples of the bombastic, the over-wrought, the puerile. These faults
are not the sins of “minds generous and aspiring,” and we have them with
us
<span class = "pagenum">xxvii</span>
always. The additions to Boileau’s preface (Paris, 1772) contain
abundance of examples of faults from Voiture, Mascaron, Bossuet,
selected by M. de St. Marc, who no doubt found abundance of
entertainment in the chastising of these obvious affectations. It hardly
seems the proper work for an author like him who wrote the Treatise on
the Sublime. But it is tempting, even now, to give contemporary
instances of skill in the Art of Sinking&mdash;modern cases of bombast,
triviality, false rhetoric. “Speaking generally, it would seem that
bombast is one of the hardest things to avoid in writing,” says an
author who himself avoids it so well. Bombast is the voice of sham
passion, the shadow of an insincere attitude. “Even the wretched phantom
who still bore the imperial title stooped to pay this ignominious
blackmail,” cries bombast in Macaulay’s <i>Lord Clive</i>. The picture
of a phantom who is not only a phantom but wretched, stooping to pay
blackmail which is not only blackmail but ignominious, may divert the
reader and remind him that the faults of the past are the faults of the
present. Again, “The desolate islands along the sea-coast, overgrown by
noxious vegetation, and swarming with deer and tigers”&mdash;do, what
does any one suppose, perform what forlorn part in the economy of the
world? Why, they “supply the cultivated districts with abundance of
salt.” It is as comic as&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>
<div class = "verse">
“And thou Dalhousie, thou great God of War,<br>
Lieutenant-Colonel to the Earl of Mar.”
</div>

<p>Bombast “transcends the Sublime,” and falls on the other side. Our
author gives more examples of puerility. “Slips of this sort are made by
those who, aiming at brilliancy, polish, and especially attractiveness,
are landed in paltriness and silly affectation.” Some modern instances
we had chosen; the field of choice is large and richly fertile in those
blossoms. But the reader may be left to twine a garland of them for
himself; to select from contemporaries were invidious, and might provoke
retaliation. When our author censures Timaeus for saying that Alexander
took less time to annex Asia than Isocrates spent in writing an oration,
to bid the Greeks attack Persia, we know what he would have thought of
Macaulay’s antithesis. He blames Xenophon for a poor pun, and Plato,
less justly, for mere figurative badinage. It would be an easy task to
ransack contemporaries, even great contemporaries, for similar failings,
for pomposity, for the florid, for sentences like processions of
intoxicated torch-bearers, for pedantic display of cheap erudition, for
misplaced flippancy, for nice derangement of epitaphs wherein no
adjective is used which is appropriate. With a library of cultivated
American novelists and uncultivated English romancers at hand, with our
own voluminous
<span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
essays, and the essays and histories and “art criticisms” of our
neighbours to draw from, no student need lack examples of what is wrong.
He who writes, reflecting on his own innumerable sins, can but beat his
breast, cry <i>Mea Culpa</i>, and resist the temptation to beat the
breasts of his coevals. There are not many authors, there have never
been many, who did not need to turn over the treatise of the Sublime by
day and night.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i6" href =
"#note_i6">I.6</a></p>

<p>As a literary critic of Homer our author is most interesting even in
his errors. He compares the poet of the <i>Odyssey</i> to the sunset:
the <i>Iliad</i> is noonday work, the <i>Odyssey</i> is touched with the
glow of evening&mdash;the softness and the shadows. “Old age naturally
leans,” like childhood, “towards the fabulous.” The tide has flowed
back, and left dim bulks of things on the long shadowy sands. Yet he
makes an exception, oddly enough, in favour of the story of the Cyclops,
which really is the most fabulous and crude of the fairy tales in the
first and greatest of romances. The Slaying of the Wooers,
<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
that admirable fight, worthy of a saga, he thinks too improbable, and
one of the “trifles into which second childhood is apt to be betrayed.”
He fancies that the aged Homer had “lost his power of depicting the
passions”; in fact, he is hardly a competent or sympathetic critic of
the <i>Odyssey</i>. Perhaps he had lived among Romans till he lost his
sense of humour; perhaps he never had any to lose. On the other hand, he
preserved for us that inestimable and not to be translated fragment of
Sappho&mdash;<span title =
"phainetai moi kênos isos theoisin">φαίνεταί μοι κῆνος ἴσος
θεοῖσιν</span>.</p>

<p>It is curious to find him contrasting Apollonius Rhodius as
faultless, with Homer as great but faulty. The “faultlessness” of
Apollonius is not his merit, for he is often tedious, and he has little
skill in selection; moreover, he is deliberately antiquarian, if not
pedantic. His true merit is in his original and, as we think, modern
telling of a love tale&mdash;pure, passionate, and tender, the first in
known literature. Medea is often sublime, and always touching. But it is
not on these merits that our author lingers; he loves only the highest
literature, and, though he finds spots on the sun and faults in Homer,
he condones them as oversights passed in the poet’s “contempt of little
things.”</p>

<p>Such for us to-day are the lessons of Longinus. He traces dignity and
fire of style to dignity and fire of soul. He detects and denounces the
very
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
faults of which, in each other, all writers are conscious, and which he
brings home to ourselves. He proclaims the essential merits of
conviction, and of selection. He sets before us the noblest examples of
the past, most welcome in a straining age which tries already to live in
the future. He admonishes and he inspires. He knows the “marvellous
power and enthralling charm of appropriate and striking words” without
dropping into mere word-tasting. “Beautiful words are the very light of
thought,” he says, but does not maunder about the “colour” of words, in
the style of the decadence. And then he “leaves this generation to its
fate,” and calmly turns himself to the work that lies nearest his
hand.</p>

<p>To us he is as much a moral as a literary teacher. We admire that
Roman greatness of soul in a Greek, and the character of this unknown
man, who carried the soul of a poet, the heart of a hero under the gown
of a professor. He was one of those whom books cannot debilitate, nor a
life of study incapacitate for the study of life.</p>

<span class = "firstword">The</span>
treatise of Caecilius on the Sublime, when, as you remember, my dear
Terentian, we examined it together, seemed to us to be beneath the
dignity of the whole subject, to fail entirely in seizing the salient
points, and to offer little profit (which should be the principal aim of
every writer) for the trouble of its perusal. There are two things
essential to a technical treatise: the first is to define the subject;
the second (I mean second in order, as it is by much the first in
importance) to point out how and by what methods we may become masters
of it ourselves. And yet Caecilius, while wasting his efforts in a
thousand illustrations of the nature of the Sublime, as though here we
were quite in the dark, somehow passes by as immaterial the question how
we might be able to exalt our own genius to a certain degree of progress
in sublimity. However, perhaps it would be fairer to commend this
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapI_2"> </a>
writer’s intelligence and zeal in themselves, instead of blaming him for
his omissions. And since you
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
have bidden me also to put together, if only for your entertainment, a
few notes on the subject of the Sublime, let me see if there is anything
in my speculations which promises advantage to men of affairs. In you,
dear friend&mdash;such is my confidence in your abilities, and such the
part which becomes you&mdash;I look for a sympathising and discerning<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_1" href = "#note_1">1</a> critic of the
several parts of my treatise. For that was a just remark of his who
pronounced that the points in which we resemble the divine nature are
benevolence and love of truth.</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapI_3"> </a>
As I am addressing a person so accomplished in literature, I need only
state, without enlarging further on the matter, that the Sublime,
wherever it occurs, consists in a certain loftiness and excellence of
language, and that it is by this, and this only, that the greatest poets
and prose-writers have gained eminence, and won themselves a lasting
place in the Temple of Fame.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapI_4"> </a>
A lofty passage does not convince the reason of the reader, but takes
him out of himself. That which is admirable ever confounds our judgment,
and eclipses that which is merely reasonable or agreeable. To believe or
not is usually in our own power; but the Sublime, acting with an
imperious and irresistible force, sways every reader whether he will or
no. Skill in invention, lucid arrangement and disposition of facts,
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
are appreciated not by one passage, or by two, but gradually manifest
themselves in the general structure of a work; but a sublime thought, if
happily timed, illumines<a class = "tag" name = "tag_2" href =
"#note_2">2</a> an entire subject with the vividness of a
lightning-flash, and exhibits the whole power of the orator in a moment
of time. Your own experience, I am sure, my dearest Terentian, would
enable you to illustrate these and similar points of doctrine.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapII_1">II</a></h5>

<p>The first question which presents itself for solution is whether
there is any art which can teach sublimity or loftiness in writing. For
some hold generally that there is mere delusion in attempting to reduce
such subjects to technical rules. “The Sublime,” they tell us, “is born
in a man, and not to be acquired by instruction; genius is the only
master who can teach it. The vigorous products of nature” (such is their
view) “are weakened and in every respect debased, when robbed of their
flesh and blood by frigid technicalities.”
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapII_2"> </a>
But I maintain that the truth can be shown to stand otherwise in this
matter. Let us look at the case in this way; Nature in her loftier and
more passionate moods, while detesting all appearance of restraint, is
not
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
wont to show herself utterly wayward and reckless; and though in all
cases the vital informing principle is derived from her, yet to
determine the right degree and the right moment, and to contribute the
precision of practice and experience, is the peculiar province of
scientific method. The great passions, when left to their own blind and
rash impulses without the control of reason, are in the same danger as a
ship let drive at random without ballast. Often they need the spur, but
sometimes also the curb.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapII_3"> </a>
The remark of Demosthenes with regard to human life in
general,&mdash;that the greatest of all blessings is to be fortunate,
but next to that and equal in importance is to be well
advised,&mdash;for good fortune is utterly ruined by the absence of good
counsel,&mdash;may be applied to literature, if we substitute genius for
fortune, and art for counsel. Then, again (and this is the most
important point of all), a writer can only learn from art when he is to
abandon himself to the direction of his genius.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_3" href = "#note_3">3</a></p>

<p>These are the considerations which I submit to the unfavourable
critic of such useful studies. Perhaps they may induce him to alter his
opinion as to the vanity and idleness of our present investigations.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapIII_1">III</a></h5>

... “And let them check the stove’s long tongues of fire:<br>

And bring that roof in ashes to the ground:<br>
But now not yet is sung my noble lay.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_4"
href = "#note_4">4</a>
</div>

<p>
Such phrases cease to be tragic, and become burlesque,&mdash;I mean
phrases like “curling torrent flames” and “vomiting to heaven,” and
representing Boreas as a piper, and so on. Such expressions, and such
images, produce an effect of confusion and obscurity, not of energy; and
if each separately be examined under the light of criticism, what seemed
terrible gradually sinks into absurdity. Since then, even in tragedy,
where the natural dignity of the subject makes a swelling diction
allowable, we cannot pardon a tasteless grandiloquence, how much more
incongruous must it seem in sober prose!
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapIII_2"> </a>
Hence we laugh at those fine words of Gorgias of Leontini, such as
“Xerxes the Persian Zeus” and “vultures, those living tombs,” and at
certain conceits of Callisthenes which are high-flown rather than
sublime, and at some in Cleitarchus more ludicrous still&mdash;a writer
whose frothy style tempts us to travesty Sophocles and say, “He blows a
little pipe,
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
and blows it ill.” The same faults may be observed in Amphicrates and
Hegesias and Matris, who in their frequent moments (as they think) of
inspiration, instead of playing the genius are simply playing the
fool.</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapIII_3"> </a>
Speaking generally, it would seem that bombast is one of the hardest
things to avoid in writing. For all those writers who are ambitious of a
lofty style, through dread of being convicted of feebleness and poverty
of language, slide by a natural gradation into the opposite extreme.
“Who fails in great endeavour, nobly fails,” is their creed.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapIII_4"> </a>
Now bulk, when hollow and affected, is always objectionable, whether in
material bodies or in writings, and in danger of producing on us an
impression of littleness: “nothing,” it is said, “is drier than a man
with the dropsy.”</p>

<p>The characteristic, then, of bombast is that it transcends the
Sublime: but there is another fault diametrically opposed to grandeur:
this is called puerility, and it is the failing of feeble and narrow
minds,&mdash;indeed, the most ignoble of all vices in writing. By
puerility we mean a pedantic habit of mind, which by over-elaboration
ends in frigidity. Slips of this sort are made by those who, aiming at
brilliancy, polish, and especially attractiveness, are landed in
paltriness and silly affectation.
<span class = "chapnum">5</span>
<a name = "chapIII_5"> </a>
Closely associated with this is a third sort of vice, in dealing
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
with the passions, which Theodorus used to call false sentiment, meaning
by that an ill-timed and empty display of emotion, where no emotion is
called for, or of greater emotion than the situation warrants. Thus we
often see an author hurried by the tumult of his mind into tedious
displays of mere personal feeling which has no connection with the
subject. Yet how justly ridiculous must an author appear, whose most
violent transports leave his readers quite cold! However, I will dismiss
this subject, as I intend to devote a separate work to the treatment of
the pathetic in writing.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapIV_1">IV</a></h5>

<p>The last of the faults which I mentioned is frequently observed in
Timaeus&mdash;I mean the fault of frigidity. In other respects he is an
able writer, and sometimes not unsuccessful in the loftier style; a man
of wide knowledge, and full of ingenuity; a most bitter critic of the
failings of others&mdash;but unhappily blind to his own. In his
eagerness to be always striking out new thoughts he frequently falls
into the most childish absurdities.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapIV_2"> </a>
I will only instance one or two passages, as most of them have been
pointed out by Caecilius. Wishing to say something very fine about
Alexander the Great he
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
speaks of him as a man “who annexed the whole of Asia in fewer years
than Isocrates spent in writing his panegyric oration in which he urges
the Greeks to make war on Persia.” How strange is the comparison of the
“great Emathian conqueror” with an Athenian rhetorician! By this mode of
reasoning it is plain that the Spartans were very inferior to Isocrates
in courage, since it took them thirty years to conquer Messene, while he
finished the composition of this harangue in ten.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapIV_3"> </a>
Observe, too, his language on the Athenians taken in Sicily. “They paid
the penalty for their impious outrage on Hermes in mutilating his
statues; and the chief agent in their destruction was one who was
descended on his father’s side from the injured deity&mdash;Hermocrates,
son of Hermon.” I wonder, my dearest Terentian, how he omitted to say of
the tyrant Dionysius that for his impiety towards Zeus and <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling variation in original">Herakles</ins> he
was deprived of his power by Dion and Herakleides.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapIV_4"> </a>
Yet why speak of Timaeus, when even men like Xenophon and
Plato&mdash;the very demi-gods of literature&mdash;though they had sat
at the feet of Socrates, sometimes forgot themselves in the pursuit of
such paltry conceits. The former, in his account of the Spartan Polity,
has these words: “Their voice you would no more hear than if they were
of marble, their gaze is as immovable as if they were cast in bronze;
you would deem them
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
more modest than the very maidens in their eyes<ins class = "correction"
title = "close quote missing in original">.”</ins><a class = "tag" name
= "tag_5" href = "#note_5">5</a> To speak of the pupils of the eye as
“modest maidens” was a piece of absurdity becoming Amphicrates<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_6" href = "#note_6">6</a> rather than Xenophon. And
then what a strange delusion to suppose that modesty is always without
exception expressed in the eye! whereas it is commonly said that there
is nothing by which an impudent fellow betrays his character so much as
by the expression of his eyes. Thus Achilles addresses Agamemnon in the
<i>Iliad</i> as “drunkard, with eye of dog.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_7" href = "#note_7">7</a>
<span class = "chapnum">5</span>
<a name = "chapIV_5"> </a>
Timaeus, however, with that want of judgment which characterises
plagiarists, could not leave to Xenophon the possession of even this
piece of frigidity. In relating how Agathocles carried off his cousin,
who was wedded to another man, from the festival of the unveiling, he
asks, “Who could have done such a deed, unless he had harlots instead of
maidens in his eyes?”
<span class = "chapnum">6</span>
<a name = "chapIV_6"> </a>
And Plato himself, elsewhere so supreme a master of style, meaning to
describe certain recording tablets, says, “They shall write, and deposit
in the temples memorials of cypress wood”;<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_8" href = "#note_8">8</a> and again, “Then concerning walls,
Megillus, I give my vote with Sparta that we should let them lie asleep
within the ground, and not awaken them.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_9"
href = "#note_9">9</a>
<span class = "chapnum">7</span>
<a name = "chapIV_7"> </a>
And Herodotus falls pretty much under the same censure,
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
when he speaks of beautiful women as “tortures to the eye,”<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_10" href = "#note_10">10</a> though here there is some
excuse, as the speakers in this passage are drunken barbarians. Still,
even from dramatic motives, such errors in taste should not be permitted
to deface the pages of an immortal work.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapV_1">V</a></h5>

<p>Now all these glaring improprieties of language may be traced to one
common root&mdash;the pursuit of novelty in thought. It is this that has
turned the brain of nearly all the learned world of to-day. Human
blessings and human ills commonly flow from the same source: and, to
apply this principle to literature, those ornaments of style, those
sublime and delightful images, which contribute to success, are the
foundation and the origin, not only of excellence, but also of failure.
It is thus with the figures called transitions, and hyperboles, and the
use of plurals for singulars. I shall show presently the dangers which
they seem to involve. Our next task, therefore, must be to propose and
to settle the question how we may avoid the faults of style related to
sublimity.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapVI_1">VI</a></h5>

<p>Our best hope of doing this will be first of all to grasp some
definite theory and criterion of the true Sublime. Nevertheless this is
a hard matter; for a just judgment of style is the final fruit of long
experience; still, I believe that the way I shall indicate will enable
us to distinguish between the true and false Sublime, so far as it can
be done by rule.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapVII_1">VII</a></h5>

<p>It is proper to observe that in human life nothing is truly great
which is despised by all elevated minds. For example, no man of sense
can regard wealth, honour, glory, and power, or any of those things
which are surrounded by a great external parade of pomp and
circumstance, as the highest blessings, seeing that merely to despise
such things is a blessing of no common order: certainly those who
possess them are admired much less than those who, having the
opportunity to acquire them, through greatness of soul neglect it. Now
let us apply this principle to the Sublime in poetry or in prose; let us
ask in all cases, is it merely a specious sublimity? is this gorgeous
exterior a mere false and clumsy pageant,
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
which if laid open will be found to conceal nothing but emptiness? for
if so, a noble mind will scorn instead of admiring it.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapVII_2"> </a>
It is natural to us to feel our souls lifted up by the true Sublime, and
conceiving a sort of generous exultation to be filled with joy and
pride, as though we had ourselves originated the ideas which we read.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapVII_3"> </a>
If then any work, on being repeatedly submitted to the judgment of an
acute and cultivated critic, fails to dispose his mind to lofty ideas;
if the thoughts which it suggests do not extend beyond what is actually
expressed; and if, the longer you read it, the less you think of
it,&mdash;there can be here no true sublimity, when the effect is not
sustained beyond the mere act of perusal. But when a passage is pregnant
in suggestion, when it is hard, nay impossible, to distract the
attention from it, and when it takes a strong and lasting hold on the
memory, then we may be sure that we have lighted on the true Sublime.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapVII_4"> </a>
In general we may regard those words as truly noble and sublime which
always please and please all readers. For when the same book always
produces the same impression on all who read it, whatever be the
difference in their pursuits, their manner of life, their aspirations,
their ages, or their language, such a harmony of opposites gives
irresistible authority to their favourable verdict.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapVIII_1">VIII</a></h5>

<p>I shall now proceed to enumerate the five principal sources, as we
may call them, from which almost all sublimity is derived, assuming, of
course, the preliminary gift on which all these five sources depend,
namely, command of language. The first and the most important is (1)
grandeur of thought, as I have pointed out elsewhere in my work on
Xenophon. The second is (2) a vigorous and spirited treatment of the
passions. These two conditions of sublimity depend mainly on natural
endowments, whereas those which follow derive assistance from Art. The
third is (3) a certain artifice in the employment of figures, which are
of two kinds, figures of thought and figures of speech. The fourth is
(4) dignified expression, which is sub-divided into (<i>a</i>) the
proper choice of words, and (<i>b</i>) the use of metaphors and other
ornaments of diction. The fifth cause of sublimity, which embraces all
those preceding, is (5) majesty and elevation of structure. Let us
consider what is involved in each of these five forms separately.</p>

<p>I must first, however, remark that some of these five divisions are
omitted by Caecilius; for instance, he says nothing about the passions.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapVIII_2"> </a>
Now if he made this omission from a belief that the Sublime
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
and the Pathetic are one and the same thing, holding them to be always
coexistent and interdependent, he is in error. Some passions are found
which, so far from being lofty, are actually low, such as pity, grief,
fear; and conversely, sublimity is often not in the least affecting, as
we may see (among innumerable other instances) in those bold expressions
of our great poet on the sons of Aloëus&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse indent3">
“Highly they raged</div>
<div class = "verse nospace">
To pile huge Ossa on the Olympian peak,<br>
And Pelion with all his waving trees<br>
On Ossa’s crest to raise, and climb the sky;”
</div>

<p>
and the yet more tremendous climax&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“And now had they accomplished it.”
</div>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapVIII_3"> </a>
And in orators, in all passages dealing with panegyric, and in all the
more imposing and declamatory places, dignity and sublimity play an
indispensable part; but pathos is mostly absent. Hence the most pathetic
orators have usually but little skill in panegyric, and conversely those
who are powerful in panegyric generally fail in pathos.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapVIII_4"> </a>
If, on the other hand, Caecilius supposed that pathos never contributes
to sublimity, and this is why he thought it alien to the subject, he is
entirely deceived. For I would confidently pronounce that nothing is so
conducive to sublimity as an appropriate display of genuine passion,
which bursts out with a kind of “fine
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
madness” and divine inspiration, and falls on our ears like the voice of
a god.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapIX_1">IX</a></h5>

<p>I have already said that of all these five conditions of the Sublime
the most important is the first, that is, a certain lofty cast of mind.
Therefore, although this is a faculty rather natural than acquired,
nevertheless it will be well for us in this instance also to train up
our souls to sublimity, and make them as it were ever big with noble
thoughts.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapIX_2"> </a>
How, it may be asked, is this to be done? I have hinted elsewhere in my
writings that sublimity is, so to say, the image of greatness of soul.
Hence a thought in its naked simplicity, even though unuttered, is
sometimes admirable by the sheer force of its sublimity; for instance,
the silence of Ajax in the eleventh <i>Odyssey</i><a class = "tag" name
= "tag_11" href = "#note_11">11</a> is great, and grander than anything
he could have said.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapIX_3"> </a>
It is absolutely essential, then, first of all to settle the question
whence this grandeur of conception arises; and the answer is that true
eloquence can be found only in those whose spirit is generous and
aspiring. For those whose whole lives are wasted in paltry and illiberal
thoughts and habits cannot possibly produce any work worthy of the
lasting reverence of mankind.
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
It is only natural that their words should be full of sublimity whose
thoughts are full of majesty.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapIX_4"> </a>
Hence sublime thoughts belong properly to the loftiest minds. Such was
the reply of Alexander to his general Parmenio, when the latter had
observed, “Were I Alexander, I should have been satisfied”; “And I, were
I Parmenio”...</p>

<p>The distance between heaven and earth<a class = "tag" name = "tag_12"
href = "#note_12">12</a>&mdash;a measure, one might say, not less
appropriate to Homer’s genius than to the stature of his discord.
<span class = "chapnum">5</span>
<a name = "chapIX_5"> </a>
How different is that touch of Hesiod’s in his description of
sorrow&mdash;if the <i>Shield</i> is really one of his works: “rheum
from her nostrils flowed”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_13" href =
"#note_13">13</a>&mdash;an image not terrible, but disgusting. Now
consider how Homer gives dignity to his divine persons&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“As far as lies his airy ken, who sits<br>
On some tall crag, and scans the wine-dark sea:<br>
So far extends the heavenly coursers’ stride.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_14" href = "#note_14">14</a>
</div>

<p>
He measures their speed by the extent of the whole world&mdash;a grand
comparison, which might reasonably lead us to remark that if the divine
steeds were to take two such leaps in succession, they would find no
room in the world for another.
<span class = "chapnum">6</span>
<a name = "chapIX_6"> </a>
Sublime also are the images in the “Battle of the Gods”&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse indent4">
“A trumpet sound</div>
<div class = "verse nospace">
Rang through the air, and shook the Olympian height;<br>
Then terror seized the monarch of the dead,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
And springing from his throne he cried aloud<br>
With fearful voice, lest the earth, rent asunder<br>
By Neptune’s mighty arm, forthwith reveal<br>
To mortal and immortal eyes those halls<br>
So drear and dank, which e’en the gods abhor.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_15" href = "#note_15">15</a>
</div>

<p>
Earth rent from its foundations! Tartarus itself laid bare! The whole
world torn asunder and turned upside down! Why, my dear friend, this is
a perfect hurly-burly, in which the whole universe, heaven and hell,
mortals and immortals, share the conflict and the peril.
<span class = "chapnum">7</span>
<a name = "chapIX_7"> </a>
A terrible picture, certainly, but (unless perhaps it is to be taken
allegorically) downright impious, and overstepping the bounds of
decency. It seems to me that the strange medley of wounds, quarrels,
revenges, tears, bonds, and other woes which makes up the Homeric
tradition of the gods was designed by its author to degrade his deities,
as far as possible, into men, and exalt his men into deities&mdash;or
rather, his gods are worse off than his human characters, since we, when
we are unhappy, have a haven from ills in death, while the gods,
according to him, not only live for ever, but live for ever in misery.
<span class = "chapnum">8</span>
<a name = "chapIX_8"> </a>
Far to be preferred to this description of the Battle of the Gods are
those passages which exhibit the divine nature in its true light, as
something spotless, great, and pure, as, for instance, a passage which
has often been handled by my predecessors, the lines on
Poseidon:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
“Mountain and wood and solitary peak,<br>
The ships Achaian, and the towers of Troy,<br>
Trembled beneath the god’s immortal feet.<br>
Over the waves he rode, and round him played,<br>
Lured from the deeps, the ocean’s monstrous brood,<br>
With uncouth gambols welcoming their lord:<br>
The charmèd billows parted: on they flew.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_16" href = "#note_16">16</a>
</div>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "chapnum">9</span>
<a name = "chapIX_9"> </a>
And thus also the lawgiver of the Jews, no ordinary man, having formed
an adequate conception of the Supreme Being, gave it adequate expression
in the opening words of his “Laws”: “God said”&mdash;what?&mdash;“let
there be light, and there was light: let there be land, and there
was.”</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">10</span>
<a name = "chapIX_10"> </a>
I trust you will not think me tedious if I quote yet one more passage
from our great poet (referring this time to human characters) in
illustration of the manner in which he leads us with him to heroic
heights. A sudden and baffling darkness as of night has overspread the
ranks of his warring Greeks. Then Ajax in sore perplexity cries
aloud&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse indent4">
“Almighty Sire,</div>
<div class = "verse nospace">
Only from darkness save Achaia’s sons;<br>
No more I ask, but give us back the day;<br>
Grant but our sight, and slay us, if thou wilt.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_17" href = "#note_17">17</a>
</div>

<p>
The feelings are just what we should look for in Ajax. He does not, you
observe, ask for his life&mdash;such a request would have been unworthy
of his heroic soul&mdash;but finding himself paralysed by darkness,
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
and prohibited from employing his valour in any noble action, he chafes
because his arms are idle, and prays for a speedy return of light. “At
least,” he thinks, “I shall find a warrior’s grave, even though Zeus
himself should fight against me.”
<span class = "chapnum">11</span>
<a name = "chapIX_11"> </a>
In such passages the mind of the poet is swept along in the whirlwind of
the struggle, and, in his own words, he</p>

<div class = "verse indent1">
“Like the fierce war-god, raves, or wasting fire</div>
<div class = "verse nospace">
Through the deep thickets on a mountain-side;<br>
His lips drop foam.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_18" href =
"#note_18">18</a>
</div>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "chapnum">12</span>
<a name = "chapIX_12"> </a>
But there is another and a very interesting aspect of Homer’s mind. When
we turn to the <i>Odyssey</i> we find occasion to observe that a great
poetical genius in the decline of power which comes with old age
naturally leans towards the fabulous. For it is evident that this work
was composed after the <i>Iliad</i>, in proof of which we may mention,
among many other indications, the introduction in the <i>Odyssey</i> of
the sequel to the story of his heroes’ adventures at Troy, as so many
additional episodes in the Trojan war, and especially the tribute of
sorrow and mourning which is paid in that poem to departed heroes, as if
in fulfilment of some previous design. The <i>Odyssey</i> is, in fact, a
sort of epilogue to the <i>Iliad</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
“There warrior Ajax lies, Achilles there,<br>
And there Patroclus, godlike counsellor;<br>
There lies my own dear son.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_19" href =
"#note_19">19</a>
</div>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "chapnum">13</span>
<a name = "chapIX_13"> </a>
And for the same reason, I imagine, whereas in the <i>Iliad</i>, which
was written when his genius was in its prime, the whole structure of the
poem is founded on action and struggle, in the <i>Odyssey</i> he
generally prefers the narrative style, which is proper to old age. Hence
Homer in his <i>Odyssey</i> may be compared to the setting sun: he is
still as great as ever, but he has lost his fervent heat. The strain is
now pitched to a lower key than in the “Tale of Troy divine”: we begin
to miss that high and equable sublimity which never flags or sinks, that
continuous current of moving incidents, those rapid transitions, that
force of eloquence, that opulence of imagery which is ever true to
Nature. Like the sea when it retires upon itself and leaves its shores
waste and bare, henceforth the tide of sublimity begins to ebb, and
draws us away into the dim region of myth and legend.
<span class = "chapnum">14</span>
<a name = "chapIX_14"> </a>
In saying this I am not forgetting the fine storm-pieces in the
<i>Odyssey</i>, the story of the Cyclops,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_20" href = "#note_20">20</a> and other striking passages. It is
Homer grown old I am discussing, but still it is Homer. Yet in every one
of these passages the mythical predominates over the real.</p>

<p>My purpose in making this digression was, as I
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
said, to point out into what trifles the second childhood of genius is
too apt to be betrayed; such, I mean, as the bag in which the winds are
confined,<a class = "tag" name = "tag_21" href = "#note_21">21</a> the
tale of Odysseus’s comrades being changed by Circe into swine<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_22" href = "#note_22">22</a> (“whimpering porkers”
Zoïlus called them), and how Zeus was fed like a nestling by the
doves,<a class = "tag" name = "tag_23" href = "#note_23">23</a> and how
Odysseus passed ten nights on the shipwreck without food,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_24" href = "#note_24">24</a> and the improbable
incidents in the slaying of the suitors.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_25"
href = "#note_25">25</a> When Homer nods like this, we must be content
to say that he dreams as Zeus might dream.
<span class = "chapnum">15</span>
<a name = "chapIX_15"> </a>
Another reason for these remarks on the <i>Odyssey</i> is that I wished
to make you understand that great poets and prose-writers, after they
have lost their power of depicting the passions, turn naturally to the
delineation of character. Such, for instance, is the lifelike and
characteristic picture of the palace of Odysseus, which may be called a
sort of comedy of manners.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapX_1">X</a></h5>

<p>Let us now consider whether there is anything further which conduces
to the Sublime in writing. It is a law of Nature that in all things
there are certain constituent parts, coexistent with their substance. It
necessarily follows, therefore, that
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
one cause of sublimity is the choice of the most striking circumstances
involved in whatever we are describing, and, further, the power of
afterwards combining them into one animate whole. The reader is
attracted partly by the selection of the incidents, partly by the skill
which has welded them together. For instance, Sappho, in dealing with
the passionate manifestations attending on the frenzy of lovers, always
chooses her strokes from the signs which she has observed to be actually
exhibited in such cases. But her peculiar excellence lies in the
felicity with which she chooses and unites together the most striking
and powerful features.</p>

<div class = "verse space">
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>

“I deem that man divinely blest<br>
Who sits, and, gazing on thy face,<br>

This, this it is that made my heart<br>

Is it not wonderful how at the same moment
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
soul, body, ears, tongue, eyes, colour, all fail her, and are lost to
her as completely as if they were not her own? Observe too how her
sensations contradict one another&mdash;she freezes, she burns, she
raves, she reasons, and all at the same instant. And this description is
designed to show that she is assailed, not by any particular emotion,
but by a tumult of different emotions. All these tokens belong to the
passion of love; but it is in the choice, as I said, of the most
striking features, and in the combination of them into one picture, that
the perfection of this Ode of Sappho’s lies. Similarly Homer in his
descriptions of tempests always picks out the most terrific
circumstances.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapX_4"> </a>
The poet of the “Arimaspeia” intended the following lines to be
grand&mdash;</p>

<div class = "versepair">
“Herein I find a wonder passing strange,<br>
That men should make their dwelling on the deep,</div>
<div class = "versepair nospace">
Who far from land essaying bold to range<br>
With anxious heart their toilsome vigils keep;<br>

And oft each shivering wretch, constrained to weep,</div>
<div class = "verse nospace">
With suppliant hands to move heaven’s pity strives,<br>
While many a direful qualm his very vitals rives.”
</div>

<p>
All must see that there is more of ornament than of terror in the
description. Now let us turn to Homer.
<span class = "chapnum">5</span>
<a name = "chapX_5"> </a>
One passage will suffice to show the contrast.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
“On them he leaped, as leaps a raging wave,<br>
Child of the winds, under the darkening clouds,<br>
On a swift ship, and buries her in foam;<br>
Then cracks the sail beneath the roaring blast,<br>
And quakes the breathless seamen’s shuddering heart<br>
In terror dire: death lours on every wave.”<a class = "tag" name =

</div>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "chapnum">6</span>
<a name = "chapX_6"> </a>
Aratus has tried to give a new turn to this last thought&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“But one frail timber shields them from their doom,”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_27" href = "#note_27">27</a>&mdash;
</div>

<p>
banishing by this feeble piece of subtlety all the terror from his
description; setting limits, moreover, to the peril described by saying
“shields them”; for so long as it shields them it matters not whether
the “timber” be “frail” or stout. But Homer does not set any fixed limit
to the danger, but gives us a vivid picture of men a thousand times on
the brink of destruction, every wave threatening them with instant
death. Moreover, by his bold and forcible combination of prepositions of
opposite meaning he tortures his language to imitate the agony of the
scene, the constraint which is put on the words accurately reflecting
the anxiety of the sailors’ minds, and the diction being stamped, as it
were, with the peculiar terror of the situation.
<span class = "chapnum">7</span>
<a name = "chapX_7"> </a>
Similarly Archilochus in his description of the shipwreck, and similarly
Demosthenes when he describes how the news came of the taking of
Elatea<a class = "tag" name = "tag_28" href =
"#note_28">28</a>&mdash;“It was evening,”
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
etc. Each of these authors fastidiously rejects whatever is not
essential to the subject, and in putting together the most vivid
features is careful to guard against the interposition of anything
frivolous, unbecoming, or tiresome. Such blemishes mar the general
effect, and give a patched and gaping appearance to the edifice of
sublimity, which ought to be built up in a solid and uniform
structure.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXI_1">XI</a></h5>

<p>Closely associated with the part of our subject we have just treated
of is that excellence of writing which is called amplification, when a
writer or pleader, whose theme admits of many successive starting-points
and pauses, brings on one impressive point after another in a continuous
and ascending scale.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXI_2"> </a>
Now whether this is employed in the treatment of a commonplace, or in
the way of exaggeration, whether to place arguments or facts in a strong
light, or in the disposition of actions, or of passions&mdash;for
amplification takes a hundred different shapes&mdash;in all cases the
orator must be cautioned that none of these methods is complete without
the aid of sublimity,&mdash;unless, indeed, it be our object to excite
pity, or to depreciate an opponent’s argument. In all other uses of
amplification, if you subtract the element of sublimity you will take as
it were the
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
soul from the body. No sooner is the support of sublimity removed than
the whole becomes lifeless, nerveless, and dull.</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXI_3"> </a>
There is a difference, however, between the rules I am now giving and
those just mentioned. Then I was speaking of the delineation and
co-ordination of the principal circumstances. My next task, therefore,
must be briefly to define this difference, and with it the general
distinction between amplification and sublimity. Our whole discourse
will thus gain in clearness.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXII_1">XII</a></h5>

<p>I must first remark that I am not satisfied with the definition of
amplification generally given by authorities on rhetoric. They explain
it to be a form of language which invests the subject with a certain
grandeur. Yes, but this definition may be applied indifferently to
sublimity, pathos, and the use of figurative language, since all these
invest the discourse with some sort of grandeur. The difference seems to
me to lie in this, that sublimity gives elevation to a subject, while
amplification gives extension as well. Thus the sublime is often
conveyed in a single thought,<a class = "tag" name = "tag_29" href =
"#note_29">29</a> but amplification can only subsist with a certain
prolixity and diffusiveness.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXII_2"> </a>
The most general definition of amplification would
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
explain it to consist in the gathering together of all the constituent
parts and topics of a subject, emphasising the argument by repeated
insistence, herein differing from proof, that whereas the object of
proof is logical demonstration, ...</p>

<p>Plato, like the sea, pours forth his riches in a copious and
expansive flood.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXII_3"> </a>
Hence the style of the orator, who is the greater master of our
emotions, is often, as it were, red-hot and ablaze with passion, whereas
Plato, whose strength lay in a sort of weighty and sober magnificence,
though never frigid, does not rival the thunders of Demosthenes.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXII_4"> </a>
And, if a Greek may be allowed to express an opinion on the subject of
Latin literature, I think the same difference may be discerned in the
grandeur of Cicero as compared with that of his Grecian rival. The
sublimity of Demosthenes is generally sudden and abrupt: that of Cicero
is equally diffused. Demosthenes is vehement, rapid, vigorous, terrible;
he burns and sweeps away all before him; and hence we may liken him to a
whirlwind or a thunderbolt: Cicero is like a widespread conflagration,
which rolls over and feeds on all around it, whose fire is extensive and
burns long, breaking out successively in different places, and finding
its fuel now here, now there.
<span class = "chapnum">5</span>
<a name = "chapXII_5"> </a>
Such points, however, I resign to your more competent judgment.</p>

<p>To resume, then, the high-strung sublimity of
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
Demosthenes is appropriate to all cases where it is desired to
exaggerate, or to rouse some vehement emotion, and generally when we
want to carry away our audience with us. We must employ the diffusive
style, on the other hand, when we wish to overpower them with a flood of
language. It is suitable, for example, to familiar topics, and to
perorations in most cases, and to digressions, and to all descriptive
and declamatory passages, and in dealing with history or natural
science, and in numerous other cases.</p>

<p>To return, however, to Plato: how grand he can be with all that
gentle and noiseless flow of eloquence you will be reminded by this
characteristic passage, which you have read in his <i>Republic</i>:
“They, therefore, who have no knowledge of wisdom and virtue, whose
lives are passed in feasting and similar joys, are borne downwards, as
is but natural, and in this region they wander all their lives; but they
never lifted up their eyes nor were borne upwards to the true world
above, nor ever tasted of pleasure abiding and unalloyed; but like
beasts they ever look downwards, and their heads are bent to the ground,
or rather to the table; they feed full their bellies and their lusts,
and longing ever more and more for such things they kick and gore one
another
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
with horns and hoofs of iron, and slay one another in their insatiable
desires.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_30" href = "#note_30">30</a></p>

We may learn from this author, if we would but observe his example, that
there is yet another path besides those mentioned which leads to sublime
heights. What path do I mean? The emulous imitation of the great poets
and prose-writers of the past. On this mark, dear friend, let us keep
our eyes ever steadfastly fixed. Many gather the divine impulse from
another’s spirit, just as we are told that the Pythian priestess, when
she takes her seat on the tripod, where there is said to be a rent in
the ground breathing upwards a heavenly emanation, straightway conceives
from that source the godlike gift of prophecy, and utters her inspired
oracles; so likewise from the mighty genius of the great writers of
antiquity there is carried into the souls of their rivals, as from a
fount of inspiration, an effluence which breathes upon them until, even
though their natural temper be but cold, they share the sublime
enthusiasm of others.

Thus Homer’s name is associated with a numerous band of illustrious
disciples&mdash;not only Herodotus, but Stesichorus before him, and the
great Archilochus, and above all Plato, who from the great fountain-head
of Homer’s genius drew into himself innumerable tributary streams.
Perhaps it would have been necessary to illustrate
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
this point, had not Ammonius and his school already classified and noted
down the various examples.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXIII_4"> </a>
Now what I am speaking of is not plagiarism, but resembles the process
of copying from fair forms or statues or works of skilled labour. Nor in
my opinion would so many fair flowers of imagery have bloomed among the
philosophical dogmas of Plato, nor would he have risen so often to the
language and topics of poetry, had he not engaged heart and soul in a
contest for precedence with Homer, like a young champion entering the
lists against a veteran. It may be that he showed too ambitious a spirit
in venturing on such a duel; but nevertheless it was not without
advantage to him: “for strife like this,” as Hesiod says, “is good for
men.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_31" href = "#note_31">31</a> And where
shall we find a more glorious arena or a nobler crown than here, where
even defeat at the hands of our predecessors is not ignoble?</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXIV_1">XIV</a></h5>

<p>Therefore it is good for us also, when we are labouring on some
subject which demands a lofty and majestic style, to imagine to
ourselves how Homer might have expressed this or that, or how Plato or
Demosthenes would have clothed it with
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
sublimity, or, in history, Thucydides. For by our fixing an eye of
rivalry on those high examples they will become like beacons to guide
us, and will perhaps lift up our souls to the fulness of the stature we
conceive.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXIV_2"> </a>
And it would be still better should we try to realise this further
thought, How would Homer, had he been here, or how would Demosthenes,
have listened to what I have written, or how would they have been
affected by it? For what higher incentive to exertion could a writer
have than to imagine such judges or such an audience of his works, and
to give an account of his writings with heroes like these to criticise
and look on?
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXIV_3"> </a>
Yet more inspiring would be the thought, With what feelings will future
ages through all time read these my works? If this should awaken a fear
in any writer that he will not be intelligible to his contemporaries it
will necessarily follow that the conceptions of his mind will be crude,
maimed, and abortive, and lacking that ripe perfection which alone can
win the applause of ages to come.</p>

<p>The dignity, grandeur, and energy of a style largely depend on a
proper employment of images, a term which I prefer to that usually
given.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_32" href = "#note_32">32</a> The
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
term image in its most general acceptation includes every thought,
howsoever presented, which issues in speech. But the term is now
generally confined to those cases when he who is speaking, by reason of
the rapt and excited state of his feelings, imagines himself to see what
he is talking about, and produces a similar illusion in his hearers.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXV_2"> </a>
Poets and orators both employ images, but with a very different object,
as you are well aware. The poetical image is designed to astound; the
oratorical image to give perspicuity. Both, however, seek to work on the
emotions.</p>

Euripides found his chief delight in the labour of giving tragic
expression to these two passions of madness and love, showing here a
real mastery which I cannot think he exhibited elsewhere. Still, he is
by no means diffident in venturing on other fields of the imagination.
His genius was far from being of the highest order, but
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
by taking pains he often raises himself to a tragic elevation. In his
sublimer moments he generally reminds us of Homer’s description of the
lion&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“With tail he lashes both his flanks and sides,<br>
And spurs himself to battle.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_35" href =

Take, for instance, that passage in which Helios, in handing the reins
to his son, says&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“Drive on, but shun the burning Libyan tract;<br>
The hot dry air will let thine axle down:<br>
Toward the seven Pleiades keep thy steadfast way.”
</div>

<p>
And then&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“This said, his son undaunted snatched the reins,<br>
Then smote the winged coursers’ sides: they bound<br>
Forth on the void and cavernous vault of air.<br>

Turn, turn thy car this way.’”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_36" href =
"#note_36">36</a>
</div>

<p>
May we not say that the spirit of the poet mounts the chariot with his
hero, and accompanies the winged steeds in their perilous flight? Were
it not so,&mdash;had not his imagination soared side by side with them
in that celestial passage,&mdash;he would never have conceived so vivid
an image. Similar is that passage in his “Cassandra,” beginning</p>

“Seven mighty men, and valiant captains, slew<br>

</div>

<p>
and describes how they all mutually pledged themselves without flinching
to die. Sometimes, however, his thoughts are unshapen, and as it were
rough-hewn and rugged. Not observing this, Euripides, from too blind a
rivalry, sometimes falls under the same censure.
<span class = "chapnum">6</span>

Sophocles has also shown himself a great master of the imagination in
the scene in which the dying Oedipus prepares himself for burial in the
midst of a tempest,<a class = "tag" name = "tag_42" href =

over his tomb just as they were
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>

none. But it would be an endless task to cite all possible examples.</p>

To return, then,<a class = "tag" name = "tag_44" href =
"#note_44">44</a> in poetry, as I observed, a certain mythical
exaggeration is allowable, transcending altogether mere logical
credence. But the chief beauties of an oratorical image are its energy
and reality. Such digressions become offensive and monstrous when the
language is cast in a poetical and fabulous mould, and runs into all
sorts of impossibilities. Thus much may be learnt from the great orators
of our own day, when they tell us in tragic tones that they see the
Furies<a class = "tag" name = "tag_45" href =
"#note_45">45</a>&mdash;good people, can’t they understand that when
Orestes cries out</p>

</div>

<p>
these are the hallucinations of a madman?</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">9</span>
<a name = "chapXV_9"> </a>
Wherein, then, lies the force of an oratorical image? Doubtless in
adding energy and passion in a hundred different ways to a speech; but
especially in this, that when it is mingled with the practical,
argumentative parts of an oration, it does not merely
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
convince the hearer, but enthralls him. Such is the effect of those
words of Demosthenes:<a class = "tag" name = "tag_47" href =
"#note_47">47</a> “Supposing, now, at this moment a cry of alarm were
heard outside the assize courts, and the news came that the prison was
broken open and the prisoners escaped, is there any man here who is such
a trifler that he would not run to the rescue at the top of his speed?
But suppose some one came forward with the information that they had
been set at liberty by the defendant, what then? Why, he would be
lynched on the spot!”
<span class = "chapnum">10</span>
<a name = "chapXV_10"> </a>
Compare also the way in which Hyperides excused himself, when he was
proceeded against for bringing in a bill to liberate the slaves after
Chaeronea. “This measure,” he said, “was not drawn up by any orator, but
by the battle of Chaeronea.” This striking image, being thrown in by the
speaker in the midst of his proofs, enables him by one bold stroke to
carry all mere logical objection before him.
<span class = "chapnum">11</span>
<a name = "chapXV_11"> </a>
In all such cases our nature is drawn towards that which affects it most
powerfully: hence an image lures us away from an argument: judgment is
paralysed, matters of fact disappear from view, eclipsed by the superior
blaze. Nor is it surprising that we should be thus affected; for when
two forces are thus placed in juxtaposition, the stronger must always
absorb into itself the weaker.</p>

On sublimity of thought, and the manner in which it arises from native

<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXVI_1">XVI</a></h5>

<p>The subject which next claims our attention is that of figures of
speech. I have already observed that figures, judiciously employed, play
an important part in producing sublimity. It would be a tedious, or
rather an endless task, to deal with every detail of this subject here;
so in order to establish what I have laid down, I will just run over,
without further preface, a few of those figures which are most effective
in lending grandeur to language.</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXVI_2"> </a>
Demosthenes is defending his policy; his natural line of argument would
have been: “You did not do wrong, men of Athens, to take upon yourselves
the struggle for the liberties of Hellas. Of this you have home proofs.
<i>They</i> did not wrong who fought at Marathon, at Salamis, and
Plataea.” Instead of this, in a sudden moment of supreme exaltation he
bursts out like some inspired prophet with that famous appeal to the
mighty dead: “Ye did not, could not have done wrong. I swear it by the
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
men who faced the foe at Marathon!”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_49" href
= "#note_49">49</a> He employs the figure of adjuration, to which I will
here give the name of Apostrophe. And what does he gain by it? He exalts
the Athenian ancestors to the rank of divinities, showing that we ought
to invoke those who have fallen for their country as gods; he fills the
hearts of his judges with the heroic pride of the old warriors of
Hellas; forsaking the beaten path of argument he rises to the loftiest
altitude of grandeur and passion, and commands assent by the startling
novelty of his appeal; he applies the healing charm of eloquence, and
thus “ministers to the mind diseased” of his countrymen, until lifted by
his brave words above their misfortunes they begin to feel that the
disaster of Chaeronea is no less glorious than the victories of Marathon
and Salamis. All this he effects by the use of one figure, and so
carries his hearers away with him.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXVI_3"> </a>
It is said that the germ of this adjuration is found in
Eupolis&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“By mine own fight, by Marathon, I say,<br>
Who makes my heart to ache shall rue the day!”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_50" href = "#note_50">50</a>
</div>

<p>
But there is nothing grand in the mere employment of an oath. Its
grandeur will depend on its being employed in the right place and the
right manner, on the right occasion, and with the right motive. In
Eupolis the oath is nothing beyond an oath; and
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
the Athenians to whom it is addressed are still prosperous, and in need
of no consolation. Moreover, the poet does not, like Demosthenes, swear
by the departed heroes as deities, so as to engender in his audience a
just conception of their valour, but diverges from the champions to the
battle&mdash;a mere lifeless thing. But Demosthenes has so skilfully
managed the oath that in addressing his countrymen after the defeat of
Chaeronea he takes out of their minds all sense of disaster; and at the
same time, while proving that no mistake has been made, he holds up an
example, confirms his arguments by an oath, and makes his praise of the
dead an incentive to the living.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXVI_4"> </a>
And to rebut a possible objection which occurred to him&mdash;“Can you,
Demosthenes, whose policy ended in defeat, swear by a
victory?”&mdash;the orator proceeds to measure his language, choosing
his very words so as to give no handle to opponents, thus showing us
that even in our most inspired moments reason ought to hold the reins.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_51" href = "#note_51">51</a> Let us mark his
words: “Those who <i>faced the foe</i> at Marathon; those who <i>fought
in the sea-fights</i> of Salamis and Artemisium; those who <i>stood in
the ranks</i> at Plataea.” Note that he nowhere says “those who
<i>conquered</i>,” artfully suppressing any word which might hint at the
successful issue of those
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
battles, which would have spoilt the parallel with Chaeronea. And for
the same reason he steals a march on his audience, adding immediately:
“All of whom, Aeschines,&mdash;not those who were successful
only,&mdash;were buried by the state at the public expense.”</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXVII_1">XVII</a></h5>

<p>There is one truth which my studies have led me to observe, which
perhaps it would be worth while to set down briefly here. It is this,
that by a natural law the Sublime, besides receiving an acquisition of
strength from figures, in its turn lends support in a remarkable manner
to them. To explain: the use of figures has a peculiar tendency to rouse
a suspicion of dishonesty, and to create an impression of treachery,
scheming, and false reasoning; especially if the person addressed be a
judge, who is master of the situation, and still more in the case of a
despot, a king, a military potentate, or any of those who sit in high
places.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_52" href = "#note_52">52</a> If a
man feels that this artful speaker is treating him like a silly boy and
trying to throw dust in his eyes, he at once grows irritated, and
thinking that such false reasoning implies a contempt of his
understanding, he perhaps flies into a rage and will not hear another
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
word; or even if he masters his resentment, still he is utterly
indisposed to yield to the persuasive power of eloquence. Hence it
follows that a figure is then most effectual when it appears in
disguise.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXVII_2"> </a>
To allay, then, this distrust which attaches to the use of figures we
must call in the powerful aid of sublimity and passion. For art, once
associated with these great allies, will be overshadowed by their
grandeur and beauty, and pass beyond the reach of all suspicion. To
prove this I need only refer to the passage already quoted: “I swear it
by the men,” etc. It is the very brilliancy of the orator’s figure which
blinds us to the fact that it <i>is</i> a figure. For as the fainter
lustre of the stars is put out of sight by the all-encompassing rays of
the sun, so when sublimity sheds its light all round the sophistries of
rhetoric they become invisible.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXVII_3"> </a>
A similar illusion is produced by the painter’s art. When light and
shadow are represented in colour, though they lie on the same surface
side by side, it is the light which meets the eye first, and appears not
only more conspicuous but also much nearer. In the same manner passion
and grandeur of language, lying nearer to our souls by reason both of a
certain natural affinity and of their radiance, always strike our mental
eye before we become conscious of the figure, throwing its artificial
character into the shade and hiding it as it were in a veil.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXVIII_1">XVIII</a></h5>

<p>The figures of question and interrogation<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_53" href = "#note_53">53</a> also possess a specific quality which
tends strongly to stir an audience and give energy to the speaker’s
words. “Or tell me, do you want to run about asking one another, is
there any news? what greater news could you have than that a man of
Macedon is making himself master of Hellas? Is Philip dead? Not he.
However, he is ill. But what is that to you? Even if anything happens to
him you will soon raise up another Philip.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_54" href = "#note_54">54</a> Or this passage: “Shall we sail
against Macedon? And where, asks one, shall we effect a landing? The war
itself will show us where Philip’s weak places lie.”<a class = "tag"
href = "#note_54">54</a> Now if this had been put baldly
it would have lost greatly in force. As we see it, it is full of the
quick alternation of question and answer. The orator replies to himself
as though he were meeting another man’s objections. And this figure not
only raises the tone of his words but makes them more convincing.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXVIII_2"> </a>
For an exhibition of feeling has then most effect on an audience when it
appears to flow naturally from the occasion, not to have been laboured
by the art of the speaker; and this device of questioning and replying
to himself reproduces
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
the moment of passion. For as a sudden question addressed to an
individual will sometimes startle him into a reply which is an unguarded
expression of his genuine sentiments, so the figure of question and
interrogation blinds the judgment of an audience, and deceives them into
a belief that what is really the result of labour in every detail has
been struck out of the speaker by the inspiration of the moment.</p>

<p>There is one passage in Herodotus which is generally credited with
extraordinary sublimity....</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXIX_1">XIX</a></h5>

<p>... The removal of connecting particles gives a quick rush and
“torrent rapture” to a passage, the writer appearing to be actually
almost left behind by his own words. There is an example in Xenophon:
“Clashing their shields together they pushed, they fought, they slew,
they fell.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_55" href = "#note_55">55</a> And
the words of Eurylochus in the <i>Odyssey</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“We passed at thy command the woodland’s shade;<br>
We found a stately hall built in a mountain glade.”<a class = "tag" name
= "tag_56" href = "#note_56">56</a>
</div>

<p>
Words thus severed from one another without the intervention of stops
give a lively impression of one who through distress of mind at once
halts and
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
hurries in his speech. And this is what Homer has expressed by using the
figure <i>Asyndeton</i>.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXX_1">XX</a></h5>

<p>But nothing is so conducive to energy as a combination of different
figures, when two or three uniting their resources mutually contribute
to the vigour, the cogency, and the beauty of a speech. So Demosthenes
in his speech against Meidias repeats the same words and breaks up his
sentences in one lively descriptive passage: “He who receives a blow is
hurt in many ways which he could not even describe to another, by
gesture, by look, by tone.”
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXX_2"> </a>
Then, to vary the movement of his speech, and prevent it from standing
still (for stillness produces rest, but passion requires a certain
disorder of language, imitating the agitation and commotion of the
soul), he at once dashes off in another direction, breaking up his words
again, and repeating them in a different form, “by gesture, by look, by
tone&mdash;when insult, when hatred, is added to violence, when he is
struck with the fist, when he is struck as a slave!” By such means the
orator imitates the action of Meidias, dealing blow upon blow on the
minds of his judges. Immediately after like a hurricane he makes a fresh
attack: “When he is struck with the fist, when he is struck in the face;
this is what moves, this is what
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
maddens a man, unless he is inured to outrage; no one could describe all
this so as to bring home to his hearers its bitterness.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_57" href = "#note_57">57</a> You see how he preserves, by
continual variation, the intrinsic force of these repetitions and broken
clauses, so that his order seems irregular, and conversely his
irregularity acquires a certain measure of order.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXI_1">XXI</a></h5>

<p>Supposing we add the conjunctions, after the practice of Isocrates
and his school: “Moreover, I must not omit to mention that he who
strikes a blow may hurt in many ways, in the first place by gesture, in
the second place by look, in the third and last place by his tone.” If
you compare the words thus set down in logical sequence with the
expressions of the “Meidias,” you will see that the rapidity and rugged
abruptness of passion, when all is made regular by connecting links,
will be smoothed away, and the whole point and fire of the passage will
at once disappear.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXI_2"> </a>
For as, if you were to bind two runners together, they will forthwith be
deprived of all liberty of movement, even so passion rebels against the
trammels of conjunctions and other particles, because they curb its free
rush and destroy the impression of mechanical impulse.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXII_1">XXII</a></h5>

<p>The figure hyperbaton belongs to the same class. By hyperbaton we
mean a transposition of words or thoughts from their usual order,
bearing unmistakably the characteristic stamp of violent mental
agitation. In real life we often see a man under the influence of rage,
or fear, or indignation, or beside himself with jealousy, or with some
other out of the interminable list of human passions, begin a sentence,
and then swerve aside into some inconsequent parenthesis, and then again
double back to his original statement, being borne with quick turns by
his distress, as though by a shifting wind, now this way, now that, and
playing a thousand capricious variations on his words, his thoughts, and
the natural order of his discourse. Now the figure hyperbaton is the
means which is employed by the best writers to imitate these signs of
natural emotion. For art is then perfect when it seems to be nature, and
nature, again, is most effective when pervaded by the unseen presence of
art. An illustration will be found in the speech of Dionysius of Phocaea
in Herodotus: “A hair’s breadth now decides our destiny, Ionians,
whether we shall live as freemen or as slaves&mdash;ay, as runaway
slaves. Now, therefore, if you choose to endure a little hardship, you
will be
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
able at the cost of some present exertion to overcome your
enemies.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_58" href = "#note_58">58</a>
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXII_2"> </a>
The regular sequence here would have been: “Ionians, now is the time for
you to endure a little hardship; for a hair’s breadth will now decide
our destiny.” But the Phocaean transposes the title “Ionians,” rushing
at once to the subject of alarm, as though in the terror of the moment
he had forgotten the usual address to his audience. Moreover, he inverts
the logical order of his thoughts, and instead of beginning with the
necessity for exertion, which is the point he wishes to urge upon them,
he first gives them the reason for that necessity in the words, “a
hair’s breadth now decides our destiny,” so that his words seem
unpremeditated, and forced upon him by the crisis.</p>

Thucydides surpasses all other writers in the bold use of this figure,
even breaking up sentences which are by their nature absolutely one and
indivisible. But nowhere do we find it so unsparingly employed as in
Demosthenes, who though not so daring in his manner of using it as the
elder writer is very happy in giving to his speeches by frequent
transpositions the lively air of unstudied debate. Moreover, he drags,
as it were, his audience with him into the perils of a long inverted
clause.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXXII_4"> </a>
He often begins to say something, then leaves the thought in suspense,
meanwhile thrusting in between,
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
in a position apparently foreign and unnatural, some extraneous matters,
one upon another, and having thus made his hearers fear lest the whole
discourse should break down, and forced them into eager sympathy with
the danger of the speaker, when he is nearly at the end of a period he
adds just at the right moment, <i>i.e.</i> when it is least expected,
the point which they have been waiting for so long. And thus by the very
boldness and hazard of his inversions he produces a much more astounding
effect. I forbear to cite examples, as they are too numerous to
require&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of different cases, the enumeration of particulars,
and the use of contrast and climax, all, as you know, add much vigour,
and give beauty and great elevation and life to a style. The diction
also gains greatly in diversity and movement by changes of case, time,
person, number, and gender.</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXIII_2"> </a>
With regard to change of number: not only is the style improved by the
use of those words which, though singular in form, are found on
inspection to be plural in meaning, as in the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“A countless host dispersed along the sand<br>
With joyous cries the shoal of tunny hailed,”
</div>

<p>
but it is more worthy of observation that plurals
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
for singulars sometimes fall with a more impressive dignity, rousing the
imagination by the mere sense of vast number.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXXIII_3"> </a>
Such is the effect of those words of Oedipus in Sophocles&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse indent3">
“Oh fatal, fatal ties!</div>
<div class = "verse nospace">
Ye gave us birth, and we being born ye sowed<br>
The self-same seed, and gave the world to view<br>

Brides, mothers, wives.... Ay, ye laid bare<br>
The blackest, deepest place where Shame can dwell.”<a class = "tag" name

</div>

<p>
Here we have in either case but one person, first Oedipus, then Jocasta;
but the expansion of number into the plural gives an impression of
multiplied calamity. So in the following plurals&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“There came forth Hectors, and there came Sarpedons.”
</div>

<p>
And in those words of Plato’s (which we have
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXXIII_4"> </a>
already adduced elsewhere), referring to the Athenians: “We have no
Pelopses or Cadmuses or Aegyptuses or Danauses, or any others out of all
the mob of Hellenised barbarians, dwelling among us; no, this is the
land of pure Greeks, with no mixture of foreign elements,”<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_60" href = "#note_60">60</a> etc. Such an accumulation
of words in the plural number necessarily gives greater pomp and sound
to a subject. But we must only have recourse to this device when the
nature of our theme makes it allowable to amplify, to multiply, or to
speak in the tones of exaggeration or
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
passion. To overlay every sentence with ornament<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_61" href = "#note_61">61</a> is very pedantic.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXIV_1">XXIV</a></h5>

<p>On the other hand, the contraction of plurals into singulars
sometimes creates an appearance of great dignity; as in that phrase of
Demosthenes: “Thereupon all Peloponnesus was divided.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_62" href = "#note_62">62</a> There is another in Herodotus:
“When Phrynichus brought a drama on the stage entitled <i>The Taking of
Miletus</i>, the whole theatre fell a weeping”&mdash;instead of “all the
spectators.” This knitting together of a number of scattered particulars
into one whole gives them an aspect of corporate life. And the beauty of
both uses lies, I think, in their betokening emotion, by giving a sudden
change of complexion to the circumstances,&mdash;whether a word which is
strictly singular is unexpectedly changed into a plural,&mdash;or
whether a number of isolated units are combined by the use of a single
sonorous word under one head.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXV_1">XXV</a></h5>

<p>When past events are introduced as happening in present time the
narrative form is changed into
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
a dramatic action. Such is that description in Xenophon: “A man who has
fallen, and is being trampled under foot by Cyrus’s horse, strikes the
belly of the animal with his scimitar; the horse starts aside and
unseats Cyrus, and he falls.” Similarly in many passages of
Thucydides.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXVI_1">XXVI</a></h5>

<p>Equally dramatic is the interchange of persons, often making a reader
fancy himself to be moving in the midst of the perils
described&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“Unwearied, thou wouldst deem, with toil unspent,<br>
They met in war; so furiously they fought.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_63" href = "#note_63">63</a>
</div>

<p>
and that line in Aratus&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“Beware that month to tempt the surging sea.”<a class = "tag" name =

In the same way Herodotus: “Passing from the city of Elephantine you
will sail upwards until you reach a level plain. You cross this region,
and there entering another ship you will sail on for two days, and so
reach a great city, whose name is Meroe.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_65" href = "#note_65">65</a> Observe how he takes us, as it were,
by the hand, and leads us in spirit through these places, making us no
longer readers, but spectators. Such a direct personal address always
has the effect of placing the reader in the midst of the scene of
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
action.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXXVI_3"> </a>
And by pointing your words to the individual reader, instead of to the
readers generally, as in the line</p>

<div class = "verse">
“Thou had’st not known for whom Tydides fought,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_66" href = "#note_66">66</a>

<p>
and thus exciting him by an appeal to himself, you will rouse interest,
and fix attention, and make him a partaker in the action of the
book.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXVII_1">XXVII</a></h5>

<p>Sometimes, again, a writer in the midst of a narrative in the third
person suddenly steps aside and makes a transition to the first. It is a
kind of figure which strikes like a sudden outburst of passion. Thus
Hector in the <i>Iliad</i></p>

<div class = "verse">
“With mighty voice called to the men of Troy<br>
To storm the ships, and leave the bloody spoils:<br>
If any I behold with willing foot<br>
Shunning the ships, and lingering on the plain,<br>
That hour I will contrive his death.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_67"
href = "#note_67">67</a>
</div>

<p>
The poet then takes upon himself the narrative part, as being his proper
business; but this abrupt threat he attributes, without a word of
warning, to the enraged Trojan chief. To have interposed any such words
as “Hector said so and so” would have had a frigid effect. As the lines
stand the writer is left behind by his own words, and the transition is
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
effected while he is preparing for it.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXVII_2"> </a>
Accordingly the proper use of this figure is in dealing with some urgent
crisis which will not allow the writer to linger, but compels him to
make a rapid change from one person to another. So in Hecataeus: “Now
Ceyx took this in dudgeon, and straightway bade the children of <ins
class = "correction" title =
"spelling variation in original">Heracles</ins>
to depart. ‘Behold, I can give you no help;
lest, therefore, ye perish yourselves and bring hurt upon me also, get
ye forth into some other land.’”

There is a different use of the change of persons in the speech of
Demosthenes against Aristogeiton, which places before us the quick turns
of violent emotion. “Is there none to be found among you,” he asks, “who
even feels indignation at the outrageous conduct of a loathsome and
shameless wretch who,&mdash;vilest of men, when you were debarred from
freedom of speech, not by barriers or by doors, which might indeed be
opened,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_68" href = "#note_68">68</a> etc.
Thus in the midst of a half-expressed thought he makes a quick change of
front, and having almost in his anger torn one word into two persons,
“who, vilest of men,” etc., he then breaks off his address to
Aristogeiton, and seems to leave him, nevertheless, by the passion of
his utterance, rousing all the more the attention of the court.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>

The same feature may be observed in a speech of Penelope’s&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">

“Why com’st thou, Medon, from the wooers proud?<br>

<p>None, I suppose, would dispute the fact that periphrasis tends much
to sublimity. For, as in music the simple air is rendered more pleasing
by the addition of harmony, so in language periphrasis often sounds in
concord with a literal expression, adding much to the beauty of its
tone,&mdash;provided always that it is not inflated and harsh, but
agreeably blended.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXVIII_2"> </a>
To confirm this one passage from Plato will suffice&mdash;the opening
words of his Funeral Oration: “In deed these men have now received from
us their due, and that tribute paid they are now passing on their
destined journey, with the State speeding them all and his own friends
speeding each one of them on his way.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_70"
href = "#note_70">70</a> Death, you see, he calls the “destined
journey”; to receive the
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
rites of burial is to be publicly “sped on your way” by the State. And
these turns of language lend dignity in no common measure to the
thought. He takes the words in their naked simplicity and handles them
as a musician, investing them with melody,&mdash;harmonising them, as it
were,&mdash;by the use of periphrasis.

So Xenophon: “Labour you regard as the guide to a pleasant life, and you
have laid up in your souls the fairest and most soldier-like of all
gifts: in praise is your delight, more than in anything else.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_71" href = "#note_71">71</a> By saying, instead of
“you are ready to labour,” “you regard labour as the guide to a pleasant
life,” and by similarly expanding the rest of that passage, he gives to
his eulogy a much wider and loftier range of sentiment. Let us add that
inimitable phrase in Herodotus: “Those Scythians who pillaged the temple
were smitten from heaven by a female malady.”</p>

<p>But this figure, more than any other, is very liable to abuse, and
great restraint is required in employing it. It soon begins to carry an
impression of feebleness, savours of vapid trifling, and arouses
disgust. Hence Plato, who is very bold and not always happy in his use
of figures, is much ridiculed
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
for saying in his <i>Laws</i> that “neither gold nor silver wealth must
be allowed to establish itself in our State,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_72" href = "#note_72">72</a> suggesting, it is said, that if he had
forbidden property in oxen or sheep he would certainly have spoken of it

Here we must quit this part of our subject, hoping, my dear friend
Terentian, that your learned curiosity will be satisfied with this short
excursion on the use of figures in their relation to the Sublime. All
those which I have mentioned help to render a style more energetic and
impassioned; and passion contributes as largely to sublimity as the
delineation of character to amusement.</p>

<p>But since the thoughts conveyed by words and the expression of those
thoughts are for the most part interwoven with one another, we will now
add some considerations which have hitherto been overlooked on the
subject of expression. To say that the choice of appropriate and
striking words has a marvellous power and an enthralling charm for the
reader, that this is the main object of pursuit with all orators and
writers, that it is this, and this alone, which causes the works of
literature to exhibit the glowing perfections of the finest statues,
their grandeur,
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
their beauty, their mellowness, their dignity, their energy, their
power, and all their other graces, and that it is this which endows the
facts with a vocal soul; to say all this would, I fear, be, to the
initiated, an impertinence. Indeed, we may say with strict truth that
beautiful words are the very light of thought.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXX_2"> </a>
I do not mean to say that imposing language is appropriate to every
occasion. A trifling subject tricked out in grand and stately words
would have the same effect as a huge tragic mask placed on the head of a
little child. Only in poetry and ...</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXXI_1">XXXI</a></h5>

<p>... There is a genuine ring in that line of Anacreon’s&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
“The Thracian filly I no longer heed.”
</div>

<p>
The same merit belongs to that original phrase in Theophrastus; to me,
at least, from the closeness of its analogy, it seems to have a peculiar
expressiveness, though Caecilius censures it, without telling us why.
“Philip,” says the historian, “showed a marvellous alacrity in <i>taking
doses of trouble</i>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_73" href =
"#note_73">73</a> We see from this that the most homely language is
sometimes far more vivid than the most ornamental, being recognised at
once as the language of common life, and gaining immediate currency by
its familiarity.
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
In speaking, then, of Philip as “taking doses of trouble,” Theopompus
has laid hold on a phrase which describes with peculiar vividness one
who for the sake of advantage endured what was base and sordid with
patience and cheerfulness.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXXI_2"> </a>
The same may be observed of two passages in Herodotus: “Cleomenes having
lost his wits, cut his own flesh into pieces with a short sword, until
by gradually <i>mincing</i> his whole body he destroyed himself”;<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_74" href = "#note_74">74</a> and “Pythes
continued fighting on his ship until he was entirely <i>hacked to
pieces</i>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_75" href = "#note_75">75</a>
Such terms come home at once to the vulgar reader, but their own
vulgarity is redeemed by their expressiveness.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXXII_1">XXXII</a></h5>

<p>Concerning the number of metaphors to be employed together Caecilius
seems to give his vote with those critics who make a law that not more
than two, or at the utmost three, should be combined in the same place.
The use, however, must be determined by the occasion. Those outbursts of
passion which drive onwards like a winter torrent draw with them as an
indispensable accessory whole masses of metaphor. It is thus in that
passage of Demosthenes (who here also is our safest guide):<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_76" href = "#note_76">76</a>
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXXII_2"> </a>
“Those vile fawning wretches, each one of whom has lopped from
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
his country her fairest members, who have toasted away their liberty,
first to Philip, now to Alexander, who measure happiness by their belly
and their vilest appetites, who have overthrown the old landmarks and
standards of felicity among Greeks,&mdash;to be freemen, and to have no
one for a master.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_77" href =
"#note_77">77</a> Here the number of the metaphors is obscured by the
orator’s indignation against the betrayers of his country.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXXXII_3"> </a>
And to effect this Aristotle and Theophrastus recommend the softening of
harsh metaphors by the use of some such phrase as “So to say,” “As it
were,” “If I may be permitted the expression,” “If so bold a term is
allowable.” For thus to forestall criticism<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_78" href = "#note_78">78</a> mitigates, they assert, the boldness
of the metaphors.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXXXII_4"> </a>
And I will not deny that these have their use. Nevertheless I must
repeat the remark which I made in the case of figures,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_79" href = "#note_79">79</a> and maintain that there are
native antidotes to the number and boldness of metaphors, in well-timed
displays of strong feeling, and in unaffected sublimity, because these
have an innate power by the dash of their movement of sweeping along and
carrying all else before them. Or should we not rather say that they
absolutely demand as indispensable the use of daring metaphors, and will
not allow the hearer to pause and criticise the number of them, because
he shares the passion of the speaker?</p>

In the treatment, again, of familiar topics and in descriptive passages
nothing gives such distinctness as a close and continuous series of
metaphors. It is by this means that Xenophon has so finely delineated
the anatomy of the human frame.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_80" href =
"#note_80">80</a> And there is a still more brilliant and life-like
picture in Plato.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_81" href =
"#note_81">81</a> The human head he calls a <i>citadel</i>; the neck is
an <i>isthmus</i> set to divide it from the chest; to support it beneath
are the vertebrae, turning like <i>hinges</i>; pleasure he describes as
a <i>bait</i> to tempt men to ill; the tongue is the <i>arbiter of
tastes</i>. The heart is at once the <i>knot</i> of the veins and the
<i>source</i> of the rapidly circulating blood, and is stationed in the
<i>guard-room</i> of the body. The ramifying blood-vessels he calls
<i>alleys</i>. “And casting about,” he says, “for something to sustain
the violent palpitation of the heart when it is alarmed by the approach
of danger or agitated by passion, since at such times it is overheated,
they (the gods) implanted in us the lungs, which are so fashioned that
being soft and bloodless, and having cavities within, they act like a
buffer, and when the heart boils with inward passion by yielding to its
throbbing save it from injury.” He compares the seat of the desires to
the <i>women’s quarters</i>, the seat of the passions to the <i>men’s
quarters</i>, in a house. The spleen, again, is the
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<i>napkin</i> of the internal organs, by whose excretions it is
saturated from time to time, and swells to a great size with inward
impurity. “After this,” he continues, “they shrouded the whole with
flesh, throwing it forward, like a cushion, as a barrier against
injuries from without.” The blood he terms the <i>pasture</i> of the
flesh. “To assist the process of nutrition,” he goes on, “they divided
the body into ducts, cutting trenches like those in a garden, so that,
the body being a system of narrow conduits, the current of the veins
might flow as from a perennial fountain-head. And when the end is at
hand,” he says, “the soul is cast loose from her moorings like a ship,
and free to wander whither she will.”
<span class = "chapnum">6</span>
<a name = "chapXXXII_6"> </a>
These, and a hundred similar fancies, follow one another in quick
succession. But those which I have pointed out are sufficient to
demonstrate how great is the natural power of figurative language, and
how largely metaphors conduce to sublimity, and to illustrate the
important part which they play in all impassioned and descriptive
passages.</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">7</span>
<a name = "chapXXXII_7"> </a>
That the use of figurative language, as of all other beauties of style,
has a constant tendency towards excess, is an obvious truth which I need
not dwell upon. It is chiefly on this account that even Plato comes in
for a large share of disparagement, because he is often carried away by
a sort of
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
frenzy of language into an intemperate use of violent metaphors and
inflated allegory. “It is not easy to remark” (he says in one place)
“that a city ought to be blended like a bowl, in which the mad wine
boils when it is poured out, but being disciplined by another and a
sober god in that fair society produces a good and temperate drink<ins

Really, it is said, to speak of water as a “sober
god,” and of the process of mixing as a “discipline,” is to talk like a
poet, and no very <i>sober</i> one either.
<span class = "chapnum">8</span>
<a name = "chapXXXII_8"> </a>
It was such defects as these that the hostile critic<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_83" href = "#note_83">83</a> Caecilius made his ground of
attack, when he had the boldness in his essay “On the Beauties of
Lysias” to pronounce that writer superior in every respect to Plato. Now
Caecilius was doubly unqualified for a judge: he loved Lysias better
even than himself, and at the same time his hatred of Plato and all his
works is greater even than his love for Lysias. Moreover, he is so blind
a partisan that his very premises are open to dispute. He vaunts Lysias
as a faultless and immaculate writer, while Plato is, according to him,
full of blemishes. Now this is not the case: far from&nbsp;it.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXXIII_1">XXXIII</a></h5>

<p>But supposing now that we assume the existence of a really
unblemished and irreproachable writer. Is it not worth while to raise
the whole question whether in poetry and prose we should prefer
sublimity accompanied by some faults, or a style which never rising
above moderate excellence never stumbles and never requires correction?
and again, whether the first place in literature is justly to be
assigned to the more numerous, or the loftier excellences? For these are
questions proper to an inquiry on the Sublime, and urgently asking for
settlement.</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXXIII_2"> </a>
I know, then, that the largest intellects are far from being the most
exact. A mind always intent on correctness is apt to be dissipated in
trifles; but in great affluence of thought, as in vast material wealth,
there must needs be an occasional neglect of detail. And is it not
inevitably so? Is it not by risking nothing, by never aiming high, that
a writer of low or middling powers keeps generally clear of faults and
secure of blame? whereas the loftier walks of literature are by their
very loftiness perilous?

I am well aware, again, that there is a law by which in all human
productions the weak points catch the eye first, by which their faults

fade away.

Yet, though I have myself noted not a few faulty passages in Homer and
in other authors of the highest rank, and though I am far from being
partial to their failings, nevertheless I would call them not so much
wilful blunders as oversights which were allowed to pass unregarded
through that contempt of little things, that “brave disorder,” which is
natural to an exalted genius; and I still think that the greater
excellences, though not everywhere equally sustained, ought always to be
voted to the first place in literature, if for no other reason, for the
mere grandeur of soul they evince. Let us take an instance: Apollonius
in his <i>Argonautica</i> has given us a poem actually faultless; and in
his pastoral poetry Theocritus is eminently happy, except when he
occasionally attempts another style. And what then? Would you rather be
a Homer or an Apollonius?
<span class = "chapnum">5</span>
<a name = "chapXXXIII_5"> </a>
Or take Eratosthenes and his <i>Erigone</i>; because that little work is
without a flaw, is he therefore a greater poet than Archilochus, with
all his disorderly profusion? greater than that impetuous, that
god-gifted genius, which chafed against the restraints of law? or in
lyric poetry would you choose to be a Bacchylides or a Pindar? in
tragedy a Sophocles or (save the mark!) an Io of Chios? Yet Io and
Bacchylides never stumble, their style is
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
always neat, always pretty; while Pindar and Sophocles sometimes move
onwards with a wide blaze of splendour, but often drop out of view in
sudden and disastrous eclipse. Nevertheless no one in his senses would
deny that a single play of Sophocles, the <i>Oedipus</i>, is of higher
value than all the dramas of Io put together.</p>

<p>If the number and not the loftiness of an author’s merits is to be
our standard of success, judged by this test we must admit that
Hyperides is a far superior orator to Demosthenes. For in Hyperides
there is a richer modulation, a greater variety of excellence. He is, we
may say, in everything second-best, like the champion of the
<i>pentathlon</i>, who, though in every contest he has to yield the
prize to some other combatant, is superior to the unpractised in all
five.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXXIV_2"> </a>
Not only has he rivalled the success of Demosthenes in everything but
his manner of composition, but, as though that were not enough, he has
taken in all the excellences and graces of Lysias as well. He knows when
it is proper to speak with simplicity, and does not, like Demosthenes,
continue the same key throughout. His touches of character are racy and
sparkling, and full of a delicate flavour. Then how admirable
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
is his wit, how polished his raillery! How well-bred he is, how
dexterous in the use of irony! His jests are pointed, but without any of
the grossness and vulgarity of the old Attic comedy. He is skilled in
making light of an opponent’s argument, full of a well-aimed satire
which amuses while it stings; and through all this there runs a
pervading, may we not say, a matchless charm. He is most apt in moving
compassion; his mythical digressions show a fluent ease, and he is
perfect in bending his course and finding a way out of them without
violence or effort. Thus when he tells the story of Leto he is really
almost a poet; and his funeral oration shows a declamatory magnificence
to which I hardly know a parallel.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXXXIV_3"> </a>
Demosthenes, on the other hand, has no touches of character, none of the
versatility, fluency, or declamatory skill of Hyperides. He is, in fact,
almost entirely destitute of all those excellences which I have just
enumerated. When he makes violent efforts to be humorous and witty, the
only laughter he arouses is against himself; and the nearer he tries to
get to the winning grace of Hyperides, the farther he recedes from it.
Had he, for instance, attempted such a task as the little speech in
defence of Phryne or Athenagoras, he would only have added to the
reputation of his rival.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXXXIV_4"> </a>
Nevertheless all the beauties of Hyperides, however numerous, cannot
make him sublime. He never
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
exhibits strong feeling, has little energy, rouses no emotion; certainly
he never kindles terror in the breast of his readers. But Demosthenes
followed a great master,<a class = "tag" name = "tag_84" href =
"#note_84">84</a> and drew his consummate excellences, his high-pitched
eloquence, his living passion, his copiousness, his sagacity, his
speed&mdash;that mastery and power which can never be
approached&mdash;from the highest of sources. These mighty, these
heaven-sent gifts (I dare not call them human), he made his own both one
and all. Therefore, I say, by the noble qualities which he does possess
he remains supreme above all rivals, and throws a cloud over his
failings, silencing by his thunders and blinding by his lightnings the
orators of all ages. Yes, it would be easier to meet the
lightning-stroke with steady eye than to gaze unmoved when his
impassioned eloquence is sending out flash after flash.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXXV_1">XXXV</a></h5>

<p>But in the case of Plato and Lysias there is, as I said, a further
difference. Not only is Lysias vastly inferior to Plato in the degree of
his merits, but in their number as well; and at the same time he is as
far ahead of Plato in the number of his faults as he is behind in that
of his merits.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">68</span>

What truth, then, was it that was present to those mighty spirits of the
past, who, making whatever is greatest in writing their aim, thought it
beneath them to be exact in every detail? Among many others especially
this, that it was not in nature’s plan for us her chosen children to be
creatures base and ignoble,&mdash;no, she brought us into life, and into
the whole universe, as into some great field of contest, that we should
be at once spectators and ambitious rivals of her mighty deeds, and from
the first implanted in our souls an invincible yearning for all that is
great, all that is diviner than ourselves.

Therefore even the whole world is not wide enough for the soaring range
of human thought, but man’s mind often overleaps the very bounds of
space.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_85" href = "#note_85">85</a> When we
survey the whole circle of life, and see it abounding everywhere in what
is elegant, grand, and beautiful, we learn at once what is the true end
of man’s being.

And this is why nature prompts us to admire, not the clearness and
usefulness of a little stream, but the Nile, the Danube, the Rhine, and
far beyond all the Ocean; not to turn our wandering eyes from the
heavenly fires, though often darkened, to the little flame kindled by
human hands, however pure and steady its light; not to think that tiny
lamp more wondrous than
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
the caverns of Aetna, from whose raging depths are hurled up stones and
whole masses of rock, and torrents sometimes come pouring from earth’s
centre of pure and living fire.</p>

<p>To sum the whole: whatever is useful or needful lies easily within
man’s reach; but he keeps his homage for what is astounding.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXXVI_1">XXXVI</a></h5>

<p>How much more do these principles apply to the Sublime in literature,
where grandeur is never, as it sometimes is in nature, dissociated from
utility and advantage. Therefore all those who have achieved it, however
far from faultless, are still more than mortal. When a writer uses any
other resource he shows himself to be a man; but the Sublime lifts him
near to the great spirit of the Deity. He who makes no slips must be
satisfied with negative approbation, but he who is sublime commands
positive reverence.

Why need I add that each one of those great writers often redeems all
his errors by one grand and masterly stroke? But the strongest point of
all is that, if you were to pick out all the blunders of Homer,
Demosthenes, Plato, and all the greatest names in literature, and add
them together, they would be found to bear a very small, or rather an
infinitesimal proportion to the passages in which
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
these supreme masters have attained absolute perfection. Therefore it is
that all posterity, whose judgment envy herself cannot impeach, has
brought and bestowed on them the crown of glory, has guarded their fame
until this day against all attack, and is likely to preserve it</p>

It has been urged by one writer that we should not prefer the huge
disproportioned Colossus to the Doryphorus of Polycletus. But (to give
one out of many possible answers) in art we admire exactness, in the
works of nature magnificence; and it is from nature that man derives the
faculty of speech. Whereas, then, in statuary we look for close
resemblance to humanity, in literature we require something which
transcends humanity.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXXXVI_4"> </a>
Nevertheless (to reiterate the advice which we gave at the beginning of
this essay), since that success which consists in avoidance of error is
usually the gift of art, while high, though unequal excellence is the
attribute of genius, it is proper on all occasions to call in art as an
ally to nature. By the combined resources of these two we may hope to
achieve perfection.</p>

<p>Such are the conclusions which were forced upon me concerning the
points at issue; but every one may consult his own taste.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXXXVII_1">XXXVII</a></h5>

<p>To return, however, from this long digression; closely allied to
metaphors are comparisons and similes, differing only in this * * *<a

<p>Such absurdities as, “Unless you carry your brains next to the ground
in your heels.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_87" href = "#note_87">87</a>
Hence it is necessary to know where to draw the line; for if ever it is
overstepped the effect of the hyperbole is spoilt, being in such cases
relaxed by overstraining, and producing the very opposite to the effect
desired.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXXXVIII_2"> </a>
Isocrates, for instance, from an ambitious desire of lending everything
a strong rhetorical colouring, shows himself in quite a childish light.
Having in his Panegyrical Oration set himself to prove that the Athenian
state has surpassed that of Sparta in her services to Hellas, he starts
off at the very outset with these words: “Such is the power of language
that it can extenuate what is great, and lend greatness to what is
little, give freshness to what is antiquated, and describe what is
recent so that it seems to be of the past.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_88" href = "#note_88">88</a> Come, Isocrates (it might be asked),
is
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
it thus that you are going to tamper with the facts about Sparta and
Athens? This flourish about the power of language is like a signal hung
out to warn his audience not to believe him.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>

We may repeat here what we said about figures, and say that the
hyperbole is then most effective when it appears in disguise.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_89" href = "#note_89">89</a> And this effect is
produced when a writer, impelled by strong feeling, speaks in the
accents of some tremendous crisis; as Thucydides does in describing the
massacre in Sicily. “The Syracusans,” he says, “went down after them,
and slew those especially who were in the river, and the water was at
once defiled, yet still they went on drinking it, though mingled with
mud and gore, most of them even fighting for it.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_90" href = "#note_90">90</a> The drinking of mud and gore, and even
the fighting for it, is made credible by the awful horror of the scene
described.

Similarly Herodotus on those who fell at Thermopylae: “Here as they
fought, those who still had them, with daggers, the rest with hands and
teeth, the barbarians buried them under their javelins.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_91" href = "#note_91">91</a> That they fought with the teeth
against heavy-armed assailants, and that they were buried with javelins,
are perhaps hard sayings, but not incredible, for the reasons already
explained. We can see that these circumstances have not been dragged in
to produce a hyperbole, but that the hyperbole has grown naturally out
of the circumstances.

For mirth is one of the passions, having its seat in pleasure. And

<p>We have still left, my dear sir, the fifth of those sources which we
set down at the outset as contributing to sublimity, that which consists
in the mere arrangement of words in a certain order. Having already
published two books dealing fully with this subject&mdash;so far at
least as our investigations had carried us&mdash;it will be sufficient
for the purpose of our present inquiry to add that harmony is an
instrument which has a natural power, not only to win and to delight,
but also in a remarkable degree
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
to exalt the soul and sway the heart of man.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>

When we see that a flute kindles certain emotions in its hearers,
rendering them almost beside themselves and full of an orgiastic frenzy,
and that by starting some kind of rhythmical beat it compels him who
listens to move in time and assimilate his gestures to the tune, even
though he has no taste whatever for music; when we know that the sounds
of a harp, which in themselves have no meaning, by the change of key, by
the mutual relation of the notes, and their arrangement in symphony,
often lay a wonderful spell on an audience&mdash;
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXXXIX_3"> </a>
though these are mere shadows and spurious imitations of persuasion,
not, as I have said, genuine manifestations of human nature:&mdash; can
we doubt that composition (being a kind of harmony of that language
which nature has taught us, and which reaches, not our ears only, but
our very souls), when it raises changing forms of words, of thoughts, of
actions, of beauty, of melody, all of which are engrained in and akin to
ourselves, and when by the blending of its manifold tones it brings home
to the minds of those who stand by the feelings present to the speaker,
and ever disposes the hearer to sympathise with those feelings, adding
word to word, until it has raised a majestic and harmonious
structure:&mdash;can we wonder if all this enchants us, wherever we meet
with it, and filling us with the sense of pomp and dignity and
sublimity, and whatever else it
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
embraces, gains a complete mastery over our minds? It would be mere
infatuation to join issue on truths so universally acknowledged, and
established by experience beyond dispute.<a class = "tag" name =

<p>

Now to give an instance: that is doubtless a sublime thought, indeed
wonderfully fine, which Demosthenes applies to his decree: <span title =
"touto to psêphisma ton tote tê polei peristanta kindunon parelthein
epoiêsen hôsper nephos">τοῦτο τὸ ψήφισμα τὸν τότε τῇ πόλει περιστάντα
κίνδυνον παρελθεῖν ἐποίησεν ὥσπερ νέφος</span>, “This decree caused the
danger which then hung round our city to pass away like a cloud.” But
the modulation is as perfect as the sentiment itself is weighty. It is
uttered wholly in the dactylic measure, the noblest and most magnificent
of all measures, and hence forming the chief constituent in the finest
metre we know, the heroic. [And it is with great judgment that the words
<span title = "hôsper nephos">ὥσπερ νέφος</span> are reserved till the
end.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_93" href = "#note_93">93</a>] Supposing
we transpose them from their proper place and read, say <span title =
"touto to psêphisma hôsper nephos epoiêse ton tote kindunon
parelthein">τοῦτο τὸ ψήφισμα ὥσπερ νέφος ἐποίησε τὸν τότε κίνδυνον
παρελθεῖν</span>&mdash;nay, let us merely cut off one syllable, reading
<span title = "epoiêse parelthein hôs nephos">ἐποίησε παρελθεῖν ὡς
νέφος</span>&mdash;and you will understand how close is the unison
between harmony and sublimity. In the passage before us the words <span
title = "hôsper nephos">ὥσπερ νέφος</span> move first in a heavy
measure, which is metrically equivalent to four short syllables: but on
removing
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
one syllable, and reading <span title = "hôs nephos">ὡς νέφος</span>,
the grandeur of movement is at once crippled by the abridgment. So
conversely if you lengthen into <span title = "hôsperei nephos">ὡσπερεὶ
νέφος</span>, the meaning is still the same, but it does not strike the
ear in the same manner, because by lingering over the final syllables
you at once dissipate and relax the abrupt grandeur of the passage.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXL_1">XL</a></h5>

<p>There is another method very efficient in exalting a style. As the
different members of the body, none of which, if severed from its
connection, has any intrinsic excellence, unite by their mutual
combination to form a complete and perfect organism, so also the
elements of a fine passage, by whose separation from one another its
high quality is simultaneously dissipated and evaporates, when joined in
one organic whole, and still further compacted by the bond of harmony,
by the mere rounding of the period gain power of tone.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXL_2"> </a>
In fact, a clause may be said to derive its sublimity from the joint
contributions of a number of particulars. And further (as we have shown
at large elsewhere), many writers in prose and verse, though their
natural powers were not high, were perhaps even low, and though the
terms they employed were usually common and popular and conveying no
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
impression of refinement, by the mere harmony of their composition have
attained dignity and elevation, and avoided the appearance of meanness.
Such among many others are Philistus, Aristophanes occasionally,
Euripides almost always.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>

Thus when <ins class = "correction" title =
"spelling variation in original">Heracles</ins> says,
after the murder of his children,</p>

<div class = "verse">
“I’m full of woes, I have no room for more,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_94" href = "#note_94">94</a>
</div>

<p>
the words are quite common, but they are made sublime by being cast in a
fine mould. By changing their position you will see that the poetical
quality of Euripides depends more on his arrangement than on his
thoughts.

</div>

<p>
The circumstance is noble in itself, but it gains in vigour because the
language is disposed so as not to hurry the movement, not running, as it
were, on wheels, because there is a distinct stress on each word, and
the time is delayed, advancing slowly to a pitch of stately
sublimity.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXLI_1">XLI</a></h5>

<p>Nothing so much degrades the tone of a style as an effeminate and
hurried movement in the language,
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
such as is produced by pyrrhics and trochees and dichorees falling in
time together into a regular dance measure. Such abuse of rhythm is sure
to savour of coxcombry and petty affectation, and grows tiresome in the
highest degree by a monotonous sameness of tone.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXLI_2"> </a>
But its worst effect is that, as those who listen to a ballad have their
attention distracted from its subject and can think of nothing but the
tune, so an over-rhythmical passage does not affect the hearer by the
meaning of its words, but merely by their cadence, so that sometimes,
knowing where the pause must come, they beat time with the speaker,
striking the expected close like dancers before the stop is reached.
Equally undignified is the splitting up of a sentence into a number of
little words and short syllables crowded too closely together and forced
into cohesion,&mdash;hammered, as it were, successively
together,&mdash;after the manner of mortice and tenon.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_96" href = "#note_96">96</a></p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXLII_1">XLII</a></h5>

<p>Sublimity is further diminished by cramping the diction. Deformity
instead of grandeur ensues from over-compression. Here I am not
referring to a judicious compactness of phrase, but to a style
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
which is dwarfed, and its force frittered away. To cut your words too
short is to prune away their sense, but to be concise is to be direct.
On the other hand, we know that a style becomes lifeless by
over-extension, I mean by being relaxed to an unseasonable length.</p>


<h5 class = "chapter"><a name = "chapXLIII_1">XLIII</a></h5>

<p>The use of mean words has also a strong tendency to degrade a lofty
passage. Thus in that description of the storm in Herodotus the matter
is admirable, but some of the words admitted are beneath the dignity of
the subject; such, perhaps, as “the seas having <i>seethed</i>” because
the ill-sounding phrase “having seethed” detracts much from its
impressiveness: or when he says “the wind wore away,” and “those who
clung round the wreck met with an unwelcome end.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_97" href = "#note_97">97</a> “Wore away” is ignoble and vulgar, and
“unwelcome” inadequate to the extent of the disaster.</p>

Similarly Theopompus, after giving a fine picture of the Persian king’s
descent against Egypt, has exposed the whole to censure by certain
paltry expressions. “There was no city, no people of Asia, which did not
send an embassy to the king; no product of the earth, no work of art,
whether beautiful
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
or precious, which was not among the gifts brought to him. Many and
costly were the hangings and robes, some purple, some embroidered, some
white; many the tents, of cloth of gold, furnished with all things
useful; many the tapestries and couches of great price. Moreover, there
was gold and silver plate richly wrought, goblets and bowls, some of
which might be seen studded with gems, and others besides worked in
relief with great skill and at vast expense. Besides these there were
suits of armour in number past computation, partly Greek, partly
foreign, endless trains of baggage animals and fat cattle for slaughter,
many bushels of spices, many panniers and sacks and sheets of
writing-paper; and all other necessaries in the same proportion. And
there was salt meat of all kinds of beasts in immense quantity, heaped
together to such a height as to show at a distance like mounds and hills
thrown up one against another.”
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXLIII_3"> </a>
He runs off from the grander parts of his subject to the meaner, and
sinks where he ought to rise. Still worse, by his mixing up
<i>panniers</i> and <i>spices</i> and <i>bags</i> with his wonderful
recital of that vast and busy scene one would imagine that he was
describing a kitchen. Let us suppose that in that show of magnificence
some one had taken a set of wretched baskets and bags and placed them in
the midst, among vessels of gold,
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
jewelled bowls, silver plate, and tents and goblets of gold; how
incongruous would have seemed the effect! Now just in the same way these
petty words, introduced out of season, stand out like deformities and
blots on the diction.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>

These details might have been given in one or two broad strokes, as when
he speaks of mounds being heaped together. So in dealing with the other
preparations he might have told us of “waggons and camels and a long
train of baggage animals loaded with all kinds of supplies for the
luxury and enjoyment of the table,” or have mentioned “piles of grain of
every species, and of all the choicest delicacies required by the art of
the cook or the taste of the epicure,” or (if he must needs be so very
precise) he might have spoken of “whatever dainties are supplied by
those who lay or those who dress the banquet.”

In our sublimer efforts we should never stoop to what is sordid and
despicable, unless very hard pressed by some urgent necessity. If we
would write becomingly, our utterance should be worthy of our theme. We
should take a lesson from nature, who when she planned the human frame
did not set our grosser parts, or the ducts for purging the body, in our
face, but as far as she could concealed them, “diverting,” as Xenophon
says, “those canals as far as possible from our senses,”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_98" href = "#note_98">98</a> and thus shunning

However, it is not incumbent on us to specify and enumerate whatever
diminishes a style. We have now pointed out the various means of giving
it nobility and loftiness. It is clear, then, that whatever is contrary
to these will generally degrade and deform&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There is still another point which remains to be cleared up, my dear
Terentian, and on which I shall not hesitate to add some remarks, to
gratify your inquiring spirit. It relates to a question which was
recently put to me by a certain philosopher. “To me,” he said, “in
common, I may say, with many others, it is a matter of wonder that in
the present age, which produces many highly skilled in the arts Of
popular persuasion, many of keen and active powers, many especially rich
in every pleasing gift of language, the growth of highly exalted and
wide-reaching genius has with a few rare exceptions almost entirely
ceased. So universal is the dearth of eloquence which prevails
throughout the world.
<span class = "chapnum">2</span>
<a name = "chapXLIV_2"> </a>
Must we really,” he asked, “give credit to that oft-repeated assertion
that democracy is the kind nurse of genius, and that high literary
excellence has
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
flourished with her prime and faded with her decay? Liberty, it is said,
is all-powerful to feed the aspirations of high intellects, to hold out
hope, and keep alive the flame of mutual rivalry and ambitious struggle
for the highest place.
<span class = "chapnum">3</span>
<a name = "chapXLIV_3"> </a>
Moreover, the prizes which are offered in every free state keep the
spirits of her foremost orators whetted by perpetual exercise;<a class =
"tag" name = "tag_99" href = "#note_99">99</a> they are, as it were,
ignited by friction, and naturally blaze forth freely because they are
surrounded by freedom. But we of to-day,” he continued, “seem to have
learnt in our childhood the lessons of a benignant despotism, to have
been cradled in her habits and customs from the time when our minds were
still tender, and never to have tasted the fairest and most fruitful
fountain of eloquence, I mean liberty. Hence we develop nothing but a
fine genius for flattery.
<span class = "chapnum">4</span>
<a name = "chapXLIV_4"> </a>
This is the reason why, though all other faculties are consistent with
the servile condition, no slave ever became an orator; because in him
there is a dumb spirit which will not be kept down: his soul is chained:
he is like one who has learnt to be ever expecting a blow. For, as Homer
says&mdash;</p>

“As, then (if what I have heard is credible), the cages
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
in which those pigmies commonly called dwarfs are reared not only stop
the growth of the imprisoned creature, but absolutely make him smaller
by compressing every part of his body, so all despotism, however
equitable, may be defined as a cage of the soul and a general
prison.”</p>

<p>

My answer was as follows: “My dear friend, it is so easy, and so
characteristic of human nature, always to find fault with the present.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_101" href = "#note_101">101</a> Consider, now,
whether the corruption of genius is to be attributed, not to a
world-wide peace,<a class = "tag" name = "tag_102" href =
"#note_102">102</a> but rather to the war within us which knows no
limit, which engages all our desires, yes, and still further to the bad
passions which lay siege to us to-day, and make utter havoc and spoil of
our lives. Are we not enslaved, nay, are not our careers completely
shipwrecked, by love of gain, that fever which rages unappeased in us
all, and love of pleasure?&mdash;one the most debasing, the other the
most ignoble of the mind’s diseases.
<span class = "chapnum">7</span>
<a name = "chapXLIV_7"> </a>
When I consider it I can find no means by which we, who hold in such
high honour, or, to speak more correctly, who idolise boundless riches,
can close the door of our souls against those evil spirits which grow up
with them. For Wealth unmeasured and unbridled
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
is dogged by Extravagance: she sticks close to him, and treads in his
footsteps: and as soon as he opens the gates of cities or of houses she
enters with him and makes her abode with him. And after a time they
build their nests (to use a wise man’s words<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_103" href = "#note_103">103</a>) in that corner of life, and
speedily set about breeding, and beget Boastfulness, and Vanity, and
Wantonness, no base-born children, but their very own. And if these
also, the offspring of Wealth, be allowed to come to their prime,
quickly they engender in the soul those pitiless tyrants, Violence, and
Lawlessness, and Shamelessness.

Whenever a man takes to worshipping what is mortal and irrational<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_104" href = "#note_104">104</a> in him, and
neglects to cherish what is immortal, these are the inevitable results.
He never looks up again; he has lost all care for good report; by slow
degrees the ruin of his life goes on, until it is consummated all round;
all that is great in his soul fades, withers away, and is despised.</p>

“If a judge who passes sentence for a bribe can never more give a free
and sound decision on a point of justice or honour (for to him who takes
a bribe honour and justice must be measured by his own interests), how
can we of to-day expect, when the whole life of each one of us is
controlled by bribery, while we lie in wait for other men’s death and
plan how to get a place in their wills, when
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
we buy gain, from whatever source, each one of us, with our very souls
in our slavish greed, how, I say, can we expect, in the midst of such a
moral pestilence, that there is still left even one liberal and
impartial critic, whose verdict will not be biassed by avarice in
judging of those great works which live on through all time?
<span class = "chapnum">10</span>
<a name = "chapXLIV_10"> </a>
Alas! I fear that for such men as we are it is better to serve than to
be free. If our appetites were let loose altogether against our
neighbours, they would be like wild beasts uncaged, and bring a deluge
of calamity on the whole civilised world.“</p>

<p>
<span class = "chapnum">11</span>
<a name = "chapXLIV_11"> </a>
I ended by remarking generally that the genius of the present age is
wasted by that indifference which with a few exceptions runs through the
whole of life. If we ever shake off our apathy<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_105" href = "#note_105">105</a> and apply ourselves to work, it is
always with a view to pleasure or applause, not for that solid advantage
which is worthy to be striven for and held in honour.</p>

account, I suppose, of <span title = "skêptou">σκηπτοῦ</span>. To

<span title = "phorbeias d’ ater">φορβειᾶς δ᾽
ἄτερ</span>, lit. “without a cheek-strap,” which was worn by trumpeters
to assist them in regulating their breath. The line is contracted from
two of Sophocles’s, and Longinus’s point is that the extravagance of
Cleitarchus is not that of a strong but ill-regulated nature, but the
ludicrous straining after grandeur of a writer at once feeble and
pretentious.</p>

<p>Ruhnken gives an extract from some inedited “versus politici” of
Tzetzes, in which are some amusing specimens of those felicities of
language Longinus is here laughing at. Stones are the “bones,” rivers
the “veins,” of the earth; the moon is “the sigma of the sky”
(<span title = "(lunate Sigma)">Ϲ</span> the old form of
<span title = "(Sigma)">Σ</span>);

The play upon the double meaning of <span title =
"kora">κόρα</span>, (1) maiden, (2) pupil of the eye, can hardly be kept
in English. It is worthy of remark that our text of Xenophon has <span
title = "en tois thalamois">ἐν τοῖς θαλάμοις</span>, a perfectly natural
expression. Such a variation would seem to point to a very early
corruption of ancient manuscripts, or to extraordinary inaccuracy on the

citation, confusing together totally different passages.</p>

Partly with the help of Toup, we may emend this corrupt passage as
follows: <span title = "lumainetai gar tauta to holon">λυμαίνεται γὰρ

process of corruption, <span title = "ta">τα</span> would easily drop
out after the final <span title = "-ta">-<span title =
"araiômata">τα</span> in ἀραιώματα</span>; <span title =
"sunoikonomoumena">συνοικονομούμενα</span> is simply a corruption of
<span title = "sunoikodomoumena">συνοικοδομούμενα</span>, which is
itself a gloss on <span title =
"sunteteichismena">συντετειχισμένα</span>, having afterwards crept into
the text; <span title = "megethos">μέγεθος</span> became corrupted into
<span title = "megethê">μεγέθη</span> through the error of some copyist,
who wished to make it agree with <span title =
"empoiounta">ἐμποιοῦντα</span>. The whole maybe translated: “Such
[interpolations], like so many patches or rents, mar altogether the
effect of those details which, by being built up in an uninterrupted
series [<span title = "tê pros allêla sch. suntet.">τῇ πρὸς ἄλληλα σχ.

<p><a href = "#chapXII_4">XII. 4. 2.</a>

passage. Longinus has just said that a writer should always work with an
eye to posterity. If (he adds) he thinks of nothing but the taste and
judgment of his contemporaries, he will have no chance of “leaving
something so written that the world will not willingly let it die.”
A book, then, which is <span title =

calling in an ally, is a common enough use. This would be clearer if we
could read <span title = "paralêphtheisi">παραληφθεῖσι</span>. I have
omitted <span title = "tou panourgein">τοῦ πανουργεῖν</span> in
translating, as it seems to me to have evidently crept in from above (p.
33, l. 25). <span title = "hê tou panourgein technê">ἡ τοῦ πανουργεῖν
τέχνη</span>, “the art of playing the villain,” is surely, in Longinus’s
own words, <span title = "deinon kai ekphulon">δεινὸν καὶ

<p><a href = "#chapXVII_2">12.</a>

what will be thought of my rendering here; it is certainly not elegant,

The text is in great confusion here. Following a hint in
Vahlin’s critical note, I have transposed the words thus: <span title =

<span title = "entha ta pathê cheimarrou dikên elaunetai">ἔνθα τὰ πάθη

κ.τ.λ.</span></p>

<p><a href = "#chapXXXII_8">8. 16.</a>
Some words have probably been lost here. The sense of <span
title = "plên">πλήν</span>, and the absence of antithesis to <span title
= "houtos men">οὗτος μέν</span>, point in this direction. The original
reading may have been something of this sort: <span title =

<span title = "all’ oude ta themata tithêsin homologoumena">ἀλλ᾽
οὐδὲ τὰ θέματα τίθησιν ὁμολογούμενα</span>, the sense being that,
though we may allow something to the partiality of Caecilius, yet this
does not excuse him from arguing on premises which are unsound.</p>

<span title = "ho de enthen helôn, k.t.l.">ὁ δὲ ἔνθεν

Toup cites a remarkable passage from Dionysius of Halicarnassus, from
which we may perhaps conclude that Longinus is referring here to
Thucydides, the traditional master of Demosthenes. <i>De Thucyd.</i> §

<h5>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LESS KNOWN WRITERS<br>
MENTIONED IN THE TREATISE ON THE SUBLIME</h5>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">Ammonius.</span>&mdash;Alexandrian
grammarian, carried on the school of Aristarchus previously to the reign
of Augustus. The allusion here is to a work on the passages in which
Plato has imitated Homer. (Suidas, <i>s.v.</i>; Schol. on Hom. Il. ix.
540, quoted by Jahn.)</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Amphikrates.</span>&mdash;Author of a book
<i>On Famous Men</i>, referred to by Athenaeus, xiii. 576, G, and Diog.
Laert. ii. 101. C. Muller, <i>Hist. Gr. Fragm.</i> iv. p. 300, considers
him to be the Athenian rhetorician who, according to Plutarch
(<i>Lucullus</i>, c. 22), retired to Seleucia, and closed his life at
the Court of Kleopatra, daughter of Mithridates and wife of Tigranes
(Pauly, <i>Real-Encyclopädie der classischen
Alterthumswissenschaft</i>). Plutarch tells a story illustrative of his
arrogance. Being asked by the Seleucians to open a school of rhetoric,
he replied, “A dish is not large enough for a dolphin” (<span title =
"hôs oude lekanê delphina chôroiê">ὡς οὐδὲ λεκάνη δελφῖνα
χωροίη</span>), v. <i>Luculli</i>, c. 22, quoted by Pearce.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Aristeas.</span>&mdash;A name involved in a
mist of fable. According to Suidas he was a contemporary of Kroesus,
though Herodotus assigns to him a much remoter antiquity. The latter
authority describes him as visiting the northern peoples of Europe and
recording his travels in an epic poem,
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
a fragment of which is given here by Longinus. The passage before us
appears to be intended as the words of some Arimaspian, who, as
belonging to a remote inland race, expresses his astonishment that any
men could be found bold enough to commit themselves to the mercy of the
sea, and tries to describe the terror of human beings placed in such a
situation (Pearce ad. l.; Abicht on Hdt. iv. 12; Suidas,
<i>s.v.</i>)</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Bakchylides</span>, nephew and pupil of the
great Simonides, flourished about 460 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> He followed his uncle to the Court of Hiero at
Syracuse, and enjoyed the patronage of that despot. After Hiero’s death
he returned to his home in Keos; but finding himself discontented with
the mode of life pursued in a free Greek community, for which his
experiences at Hiero’s Court may well have disqualified him, he retired
to Peloponnesus, where he died. His works comprise specimens of almost
every kind of lyric composition, as practised by the Greeks of his time.
Horace is said to have imitated him in his <i>Prophecy of Nereus</i>, c.
I. xv. (Pauly, as above). So far as we can judge from what remains of
his works, he was distinguished rather by elegance than by force. A
considerable fragment on the Blessings of Peace has been translated by
Mr. J.&nbsp;A. Symonds in his work on the Greek poets. He is made the
subject of a very bitter allusion by Pindar (Ol. ii. s. fin. c. Schol.)
We may suppose that the stern and lofty spirit of Pindar had little
sympathy with the “tearful” (Catullus, xxxviii.) strains of Simonides or
his imitators.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Caecilius</span>, a native of Kale Akte in
Sicily, and hence known as Caecilius Kalaktinus, lived in Rome at the
time of Augustus. He is mentioned with distinction as a learned Greek
rhetorician and grammarian, and was the author of numerous works,
frequently referred to by Plutarch and other later writers. He may be
regarded as one of the most
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
distinguished Greek rhetoricians of his time. His works, all of which
have perished, comprised, among many others, commentaries on Antipho and
Lysias; several treatises on Demosthenes, among which is a dissertation
on the genuine and spurious speeches, and another comparing that orator
with Cicero; “On the Distinction between Athenian and Asiatic
Eloquence”; and the work on the Sublime, referred to by Longinus
(Pauly). The criticism of Longinus on the above work may be thus summed
up: Caecilius is censured (1) as failing to rise to the dignity of his
subject; (2) as missing the cardinal points; and (3) as failing in
practical utility. He wastes his energy in tedious attempts to define
the Sublime, but does not tell us how it is to be attained (I. i.) He is
further blamed for omitting to deal with the Pathetic (VIII. i.
<i>sqq.</i>) He allows only two metaphors to be employed together in the
same passage (XXXII. ii.) He extols Lysias as a far greater writer than
Plato (<i>ib.</i> viii.), and is a bitter assailant of Plato’s style
(<i>ib.</i>) On the whole, he seems to have been a cold and uninspired
critic, finding his chief pleasure in minute verbal details, and
incapable of rising to an elevated and extensive view of his
subject.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Eratosthenes</span>, a native of Cyrene,
born in 275 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>; appointed by Ptolemy
III. Euergetes as the successor of Kallimachus in the post of librarian
in the great library of Alexandria. He was the teacher of Aristophanes
of Byzantium, and his fame as a man of learning is testified by the
various fanciful titles which were conferred on him, such as “The
Pentathlete,” “The second Plato,” etc. His great work was a treatise on
geography (Lübker).</p>

Greece, wandering from city to city, and acquiring wealth and fame by
practising and teaching rhetoric. We find him last in Larissa, where he
died at the age of a hundred in 375 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> As a teacher of eloquence Gorgias belongs to
what is known as the Sicilian school, in which he followed the steps of
his predecessors, Korax and Tisias. At the time when this school arose
the Greek ear was still accustomed to the rhythm and beat of poetry, and
the whole rhetorical system of the Gorgian school (compare the phrases
<span title = "gorgieia schêmata">γοργίεια σχήματα</span>, <span title =
"gorgiazein">γοργιάζειν</span>) is built on a poetical plan (Lübker,
<i>Reallexikon des classischen Alterthums</i>). Hermogenes, as quoted by
Jahn, appears to classify him among the “hollow pedants” (<span title =
"hupoxuloi sophistai">ὑπόξυλοι σοφισταί</span>), “who,” he says, “talk
of vultures as ‘living tombs,’ to which they themselves would best be
committed, and indulge in many other such frigid conceits.” (With the
metaphor censured by Longinus compare Achilles Tatius, III. v. 50, ed.
Didot.) See also Plato, <i>Phaedrus</i>, 267,&nbsp;A.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Hegesias</span> of Magnesia, rhetorician
and historian, contemporary of Timaeus (300 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>) He belongs to the period of the decline of
Greek learning, and Cicero treats him as the representative of the
decline of taste. His style was harsh and broken in character, and a
parody on the Old Attic. He wrote a life of Alexander the Great, of
which Plutarch (<i>Alexander</i>, c. 3) gives the following specimen:
“On the day of Alexander’s birth the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was
burnt down, a coincidence which occasions Hegesias to utter a conceit
frigid enough to extinguish the conflagration. ‘It was natural,’ he
says, ‘that the temple should be burnt down, as Artemis was engaged with
bringing Alexander into the world’” (Pauly, with the references).</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Hekataeus</span> of Miletus, the
logographer; born in 549 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, died
soon after the battle of Plataea. He was the author of two
works&mdash;(1) <span title = "periodos gês">περίοδος γῆς</span>; and
(2) <span title = "geneêlogiai">γενεηλογίαι</span>. The <i>Periodos</i>
deals in two books, first with Europe, then with
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
Asia and Libya. The quotation in the text is from his genealogies
(Lübker).</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Ion</span> of Chios, poet, historian, and
philosopher, highly distinguished among his contemporaries, and
mentioned by Strabo among the celebrated men of the island. He won the
tragic prize at Athens in 452 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>,
and Aristophanes (<i>Peace</i>, 421 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>) speaks of him as already dead. He was not less
celebrated as an elegiac poet, and we still possess some specimens of
his elegies, which are characterised by an Anacreontic spirit, a
cheerful, joyous tone, and even by a certain degree of inspiration. He
wrote also Skolia, Hymns, and Epigrams, and was a pretty voluminous
writer in prose (Pauly). Compare the Scholiast on Ar.
<i>Peace</i>,&nbsp;801.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Kallisthenes</span> of Olynthus, a near
relative of Aristotle; born in 360, and educated by the philosopher as
fellow-pupil with Alexander, afterwards the Great. He subsequently
visited Athens, where he enjoyed the friendship of Theophrastus, and
devoted himself to history and natural philosophy. He afterwards
accompanied Alexander on his Asiatic expedition, but soon became
obnoxious to the tyrant on account of his independent and manly bearing,
which he carried even to the extreme of rudeness and arrogance. He at
last excited the enmity of Alexander to such a degree that the latter
took the opportunity afforded by the conspiracy of Hermolaus, in which
Kallisthenes was accused of participating, to rid himself of his former
school companion, whom he caused to be put to death. He was the author
of various historical and scientific works. Of the latter two are
mentioned&mdash;(1) <i>On the Nature of the Eye</i>; (2) <i>On the
Nature of Plants</i>. Among his historical works are mentioned (1) the
<i>Phocian War</i> (read “Phocicum” for v. l. “Troikum” in Cic. <i>Epp.
ad Div.</i> v. 12); (2) a <i>History of Greece</i> in ten books; (3)
<span title = "ta Persika">τὰ Περσικά</span>, apparently identical with
the description of Alexander’s march, of which we still possess
fragments. As
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
an historian he seems to have displayed an undue love of recording signs
and wonders. Polybius, however (vi. 45), classes him among the best
historical writers. His style is said by Cicero (<i>de Or.</i> ii. 14)
to approximate to the rhetorical (Pauly).</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Kleitarchus</span>, a contemporary of
Alexander, accompanied that monarch on his Asiatic expedition, and wrote
a history of the same in twelve books, which must have included at least
a short retrospect on the early history of Asia. His talents are spoken
of in high terms, but his credit as an historian is held very
light&mdash;“probatur ingenium, fides infamatur,” Quint. x. 1, 74.
Cicero also (<i>de Leg.</i> i. 2) ranks him very low. That his credit as
an historian was sacrificed to a childish credulity and a foolish love
of fable and adventure is sufficiently testified by the pretty numerous
fragments which still remain (Pauly). Demetrius Phalereus, quoted by
Pearce, quotes a grandiloquent description of the wasp taken from
Kleitarchus, “feeding on the mountainside, her home the hollow oak.”</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Matris</span>, a native of Thebes,
author of a panegyric on <ins class = "correction" title =
"spelling variation in original">Herakles</ins>,
whether in verse or prose is uncertain. In one
passage Athenaeus speaks of him as an Athenian, but this must be a
mistake. Toup restores a verse from an allusion in Diodorus Siculus
(i.&nbsp;24), which, if genuine, would agree well with the description
given of him by Longinus: <span title =
"Êraklea kaleesken, hoti kleos esche dia Hêran">Ηρακλέα καλέεσκεν,
ὅτι κλέος ἔσχε διὰ Ἥραν</span> (see Toup ad Long. III.&nbsp;ii.)</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Philistus</span> of Syracuse, a relative of
the elder Dionysius, whom he assisted with his wealth in his attack on
the liberty of that city, and remained with him until 386 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>, when he was banished by the jealous suspicions
of the tyrant. He retired to Epirus, where he remained until Dionysius’s
death. The younger Dionysius recalled him, wishing to employ him in the
character of supporter against Dion. By
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
his instrumentality it would seem that Dion and Plato were banished from
Syracuse. He commanded the fleet in the struggle between Dion and
Dionysius, and lost a battle, whereupon he was seized and put to death
by the people. During his banishment he wrote his historical work, <span
title = "ta Sikelika">τὰ Σικελικά</span>, divided into two parts and
numbering eleven books. The first division embraced the history of
Sicily from the earliest times down to the capture of Agrigentum <ins
class = "correction" title =
"open parenthesis missing in original">(seven books)</ins>,
and the remaining four books dealt with
the life of Dionysius the elder. He afterwards added a supplement in two
books, giving an account of the younger Dionysius, which he did not,
however, complete. He is described as an imitator, though at a great
distance, of Thucydides, and hence was known as “the little Thucydides.”
As an historian he is deficient in conscientiousness and candour; he
appears as a partisan of Dionysius, and seeks to throw a veil over his
discreditable actions. Still he belongs to the most important of the
Greek historians (Lübker).</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Theodorus</span> of Gadara, a rhetorician
in the first century after Christ; tutor of Tiberius, first in Rome,
afterwards in Rhodes, from which town he called himself a Rhodian, and
where Tiberius during his exile diligently attended his instruction. He
was the author of various grammatical and other works, but his fame
chiefly rested on his abilities as a teacher, in which capacity he seems
to have had great influence (Pauly). He was the author of that famous
description of Tiberius which is given by Suetonius (<i>Tib.</i> 57),
<span title = "pêlos haimati pephuramenos">πηλὸς αἵματι
πεφυραμένος</span>, “A clod kneaded together with blood.”<a class =

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Theopompus</span>, a native of Chios; born
380 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> He came to Athens while still
a boy, and studied eloquence under Isokrates, who is said, in comparing
him with another pupil, Ephorus, to have made use of the image which we
find in
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
Longinus, c. ii. “Theopompus,” he said, “needs the curb, Ephorus the
spur” (Suidas, quoted by Jahn ad v.) He appeared with applause in
various great cities as an advocate, but especially distinguished
himself in the contest of eloquence instituted by Artemisia at the
obsequies of her husband Mausolus, where he won the prize. He afterwards
devoted himself to historical composition. His great work was a history
of Greece, in which he takes up the thread of Thucydides’s narrative,
and carries it on uninterruptedly in twelve books down to the battle of
Knidus, seventeen years later. Here he broke off, and began a new work
entitled <i>The Philippics</i>, in fifty-eight books. This work dealt
with the history of Greece in the Macedonian period, but was padded out
to a preposterous bulk by all kinds of digressions on mythological,
historical, or social topics. Only a few fragments remain. He earned an
ill name among ancient critics by the bitterness of his censures, his
love of the marvellous, and the inordinate length of his digressions.
His style is by some critics censured as feeble, and extolled by others
as clear, nervous, and elevated (Lübker and Pauly).</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Timaeus</span>, a native of Tauromenium in
Sicily; born about 352 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> Being
driven out of Sicily by Agathokles, he lived a retired life for fifty
years in Athens, where he composed his History. Subsequently he returned
to Sicily, and died at the age of ninety-six in 256 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> His chief work was a <i>History of Sicily</i>
from the earliest times down to the 129th Olympiad. It numbered
sixty-eight books, and consisted of two principal divisions, whose
limits cannot now be ascertained. In a separate work he handled the
campaigns of Pyrrhus, and also wrote <i>Olympionikae</i>, probably
dealing with chronological matters. Timaeus has been severely criticised
and harshly condemned by the ancients, especially by Polybius, who
denies him every faculty required by the historical writer (xii. 3-15,
23-28). And though Cicero
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
differs from this judgment, yet it may be regarded as certain that
Timaeus was better qualified for the task of learned compilation than
for historical research, and held no distinguished place among the
historians of Greece. His works have perished, only a few fragments
remaining (Lübker).</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Zoilus</span>, a Greek rhetorician, native
of Amphipolis in Macedonia, in the time probably of Ptolemy Philadelphus
(285-247 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>), who is said by
Vitruvius to have crucified him for his abuse of Homer. He won the name
of Homeromastix, “the scourge of Homer,” and was also known as <span
title = "kuôn rhêtorikos">κύων ῥητορικός</span>, “the dog of rhetoric,”
on account of his biting sarcasm; and his name (as in the case of the
English Dennis) came to be used to signify in general a carping and
malicious critic. Suidas mentions two works of his, written with the
object of injuring or destroying the fame of Homer&mdash;(1) <i>Nine
Books against Homer</i>; and (2) <i>Censures on Homer</i> (Pauly).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
